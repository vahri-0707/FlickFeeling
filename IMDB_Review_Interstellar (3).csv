" Out of this world
",kosmasp,31 May 2015,"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ..."
" A visual and auditory marvel

" Masterpiece
",aheaven2005,25 June 2022,A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time.
" Possibly the best movie of all time
",theoledoux,6 April 2021,"I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust..."
" I waited 5 years to watch it again
",Ksa-2010,26 June 2019,"After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again
This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"
" Masterpiece
",e-jackson1985,8 May 2022,"Amongst the best movies of all time. The story, the acting, the script, the cinematography, the effects, the sound and the production as a whole is all absolute 10/10's.But what beats all of that is Hans Zimmers compositions. How he continues to churn out perfection to the senses is mindblowing."
" 7 years later
",ravesch-83770,29 October 2021,"Sometimes I just need to see the start. Or end. Or a trailer. Or the music and theme from Hans Zimmer. Or the whole movie. Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant."
" A journey across the galaxy to save humanity
",Tweekums,27 January 2016,"Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic."
" Excellent Movie
",frank-ancestor-hunter,6 April 2015,"I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"
" Absolutely Brilliant
",gavin6942,25 January 2015,"A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics."
" I would rate 11/10
",mysteryvoiceman,24 June 2018,"I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. 
One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
" A Sci-Fi Masterpiece
",zardoz-13,25 November 2014,"Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout ""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending."
" A Visually Monumental And Thoughtful Sci-Fi Epic
",CalRhys,8 November 2014,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
" Greatest movie of all time
",FeastMode,1 July 2019,"I rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. Perfection. Mind-blowing. A workout for your brain. I want to have debates about it. I want to write research papers on it. Amazingly unbelievably awesome. This is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. Lots of amazing scenes with epic music. A killer story told flawlessly. Perfect directing by the best ever. Great cast with great acting. A deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters.The most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. One of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. The only movie I have ever liked the most the fourth time. I keep picking up on more things and a better overall understanding. So many parts are extremely moving and powerful. It does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling.EDIT on tenth viewing: This movie destroys me every time. Numerous tears EVERY TIME. And I don't just mean at the obvious emotional parts. There are so many moments where I am in complete awe at the beauty of the filmmaking I'm experiencing, to the point of tears. The way the story all comes together and the ""epiphany moment"" is so perfect that it brings me to tears.When watching movies, I sometimes think, ""this is the best thing I've ever seen"" or ""this is the coolest thing I've ever seen."" I know it's hyperbole and I've said it many times, usually at one or maybe two scenes in a movie. During Interstellar, I feel this way for about 40% of this three hour movie. Every time I watch, it re-emphasizes that it is CLEARY my favorite movie of all-time. And that musical score alone gives me goosebumps for so much of the movie. Hans is the GOAT. Nolan is the GOAT.(10 viewings, 12/2/2016, 2/26/2020, 1/11/2022, 8/9/2023)SPOILERSI was randomly thinking about Interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. I thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the tesseract is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. If plan B was what ""originally"" happened and Dr. Brand survived, future people figured it out, and they want to save those they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = Cooper and Murph. Doctor Brand knows this because she knows Cooper loves Murph, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows Murph grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future people (eventually, after her death) put the machine in the same black hole that Cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. INTRIGUING. Will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, I like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory I had about the ""original"" mission being completed without Cooper.Lots of awesome concepts that made me think, like Murphy's Law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. The robots are cool and original. Really awesome visuals of things I've wondered about but never really imagined. I liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3D in the daughter's room. The way everything connected is very awesome. The different planets are so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. The endings are perfect.Something I noticed that I didn't realize the first time is the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. He was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his son, Jesse. However, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother.The relationship between Coop and Murph is the best relationship I can remember in any movie I've seen. The primary underlying theme in the movie is the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needs to save the world.From Interstellar group chat discussion:-Or the other theory I had was that originally plan B was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan A work-So she finds out that plan a was a sham. That the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. That he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people off earth. She found out they knew they were never coming back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. So every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. She should have never been hoping. Her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste. That should break a person. Murph is a beast.-The love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. It's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. It's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. It's the only reason she saw the watch again. It's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data.12/2/16: I watched interstellar again wow. I found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used Plan B without Cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get Cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. The problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking onto the spinning blown up ship after Mann backstabbed humanity. But it actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline Cooper would not have convinced them to go to Mann's planet, Brand would have convinced them to go to Edmund's planet which was the right one. In that ""original"" timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet."

" time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece
",lark40,13 November 2014,"chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a RenascenceFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."""
" Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best
",Horst_In_Translation,25 December 2014,"To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot."
" Best movie I have seen in my life
",Patterson13,8 April 2015,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100."
" Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative
",tavm,1 December 2014,"Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think."

",matej-trkanjec-133-920386,3 April 2015,"A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece."

" Stunning sci-fi !
",deloudelouvain,19 April 2015,"Well to me this was one of the better science-fiction movies that I ever saw. It's been a long time since I didn't see a sci-fi like this one. It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years."

" Emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging
",Gordon-11,6 November 2014,
" Thought-provoking, mind-enriching, and heart wrenching sci-fi drama.
",prospectus_capricornium,5 November 2014,"'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars.To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced.At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver.Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through.Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive.'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise.This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)"
" Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY
",george.schmidt,12 November 2014,"INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!"
" ""In order for man to move forward, they must leave something behind.""
",AlukardsCastle,8 November 2014,"-Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side.That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length. I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt.In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms. Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll."
" A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.
",shawneofthedead,7 November 2014,"Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a ""ghost"" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story."
" Hm
",breadandhammers,7 September 2020,"Going against the grain, yet again. Am I the only one that was extremely distracted by plot holes, an inexplicable ""love will save the day"" ending, and Matthew McConaughey's fake tan? Alright so Matthew McConaughey is an ex spaceship pilot, stumbles upon NASA cuz, you guys, the government is evil now, is recruited for a mission to save the planet by finding another planet to colonize. Plan A is to evacuate Earth and move to that planet. That plan (SPOILERS!) is a sham. The real plan is Plan B, which is to repopulate the new planet with embryos. So is Anne Hathaway going to give birth to a hundred babies? How exactly is that going to work? They save Matt Damon. He turns out to be evil and loyal to Plan B. Sets about his own doom by ignoring all warning signs that his airlock is not secure (seriously?!). Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey set sail for another planet. But Matthew McConaughey goes rogue and gets sucked into a black hole. The power of love transports him to his daughter's bedroom (?) - but IN THE PAST YOU GUYS, and he sends messages with Morse Code. Apparently transferring all of the data he's learned about...something or another...through Morse Code (that's one heck of a compression scheme), which allows his daughter to save humanity. He then gets saved from the black hole (?). Reunites with daughter on Saturn (?). And sets up the premise for the sequel. The plot isn't so much twisting and turning as it is just convulsing and flatlining. I didn't really care about any of the characters - actually Matt Damon was the most interesting. The film takes literally an hour to get to space (just c'mon already!). And by the point that the The Power of Love intervenes, I was just sitting in my chair quietly laughing. Gravity was way better."

" Absolutely thrilling! A can't miss movie!
",michaelRokeefe,8 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!"
" An space-epic sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope.
",Pjtaylor-96-138044,12 May 2018,"'Interstellar (2014)' is a space-epic that feels remarkably intimate and emotionally resonant while also being sweeping in scope and visually stunning. The mixture of earthy textures and sleek sci-fi aesthetics makes for an interesting visual juxtaposition between the two sets of characters. While its third act does get a little existential and abstract, the narrative reasoning behind it and scientific integrity leading up to it allows for constant believability. This film never fails to have an impact on me, it is truly breathtaking work. In fact, it is one of my favourite pictures of all time. 10/10"
" 'Interstellar'
",millert1409,5 November 2014,"'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date."
" Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie
",pipoulefr,5 November 2014,
" ""We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it.""
",classicsoncall,15 November 2014,"Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story.I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if your name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises.Case in point - ""Interstellar"". Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate.Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt.It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were ""That was a piece of excrement"", only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture."

I'm 31 years old and I fall for it everytime. Probably one of the most beautiful movies ive ever seen in my life. Mathew and anne put on the performances of their lives while engaging the audience at every corner in the movie. 3 hours is a long time for a movie to run for yet by the end of the credits your yearning for more and wishing it wasn't ending. This still ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen and I don't think that will change anytime soon. Special, enthralling, epic and just perfect in every way."

" Good, but Overrated
",framptonhollis,29 August 2015,
" Disappointing
",rubenm,11 November 2014,"So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed."

" Why tack on an ending where everything works out perfectly?!
",planktonrules,22 February 2015,"The first 80-90% of ""Interstellar"" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful ""Gravity"", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay."

" What a massive disappointment
",Balthazar-5,13 November 2014,"Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years."

",hoodkevin-03831,1 November 2023,"Interstellar is a interesting film that questions the time in space in our reality a film that is straight up visually impressive The story is kind of odd but it's still worth in this type of film ever since I saw this movie I've been wondering what's up in space what type of life we can live on space and how is humans can evolve it the only thing that I did not really like was the main character being very one dimensional, but other than that this has a very good premise, and they will pay the movie that has a very good set up and pay off real well the performance was very very good and direction was... well it's Christopher Nolan 8.5/10."

After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally.Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next.Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role.I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked.All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride."

As a father who has a daughter, I'm deeply impressed how Nolan touched on this subject every time I rewatch it. It's so deep, it almost gives an ideal blueprint of how to connect with your kids on an emotional and intellectual level, and how to be the right parent for them. Any father, especially with a daughter, would understand what I mean! :) It's pure gold.I have a very close relationship with my little daughter, we are best friends, in some way similar to that of Interstellar, and I've always tried to prioritize it, but I find myself always learning something new from Cooper and Murph.As a huge sci-fi fan, I'll even completely ignore the sci-fi part in this review! :))"

" Dissymmetries, sight
",tedg,14 December 2014,"The good news that we have the brothers reunited and again working on circular narrative. Again, we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways.The device is hackneyed: messages from the future, but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy, we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love,' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention, but again, this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention.Take, for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time, but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future, but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars, buildings, clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time.More powerfully, the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s, using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from ""Forbidden Planet."" The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot, with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building.Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage, but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica.Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick, and before him Bogdanovich, Hooper, Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras, sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past.The film is also clearly in a future, after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks, denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era.But the flaw, the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority.The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide, highly polarized when the work gets going. Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect.On other unrelated matters, some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is, but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important.A bit worse: In the film, we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time, describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events, some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism, unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?"

Christopher Nolan has surpassed Stanley Kubrick in making a visually stunning but ultimately pointless piece of Sci Fi nonsense. Nobody can give me a convincing explanation of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in 1968 it was jaw dropping. Interstellar's problem is we've seen it all before, and Nolan is not Kubrick.Perhaps there is an analogy of the futility of life here, but it's spurious at best.This ranks with Prometheus as an incredibly beautiful waste of my time."

",RetroRam,29 October 2023,"Fantastic premise, script, acting, production, effects, soundtrack... this film had me hooked for its entire (long) duration. A slow burner for most of its length, Interstellar gave me a feeling I don't think I've had from a film before. Simultaneously hopeless and hopeful. Sad and uplifted. The entire time I was tense, and yet couldn't tear myself from the screen.For fairness, the first time I watched this film, when it was new, I was disinterested. The difficulty I had hearing a lot of the dialogue annoyed me, and I found the whole thing to be quite pretentious. However, watching the film again later and with a fresh mind it clicked in a new way and moved me in ways I wasn't expecting."
" It's a Chris Nolan film. All style, but no substance.
",RIK-22,19 March 2015,"As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers.I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold.Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects.On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous.The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down.On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense.If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?).Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on.They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information.Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughterAnd how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot.In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies."

",grumpy-3,10 November 2014,"His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover."

",Wrapper30,24 November 2014,"I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about."

The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million."

The movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects.In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer about religion; so the movie is about ""something"" that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?. ***END OF SPOILER***McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible.

" Disappears up its own black hole.
",BA_Harrison,10 November 2014,"As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should."

",MorpheusOne,24 July 2021,"This movie had such an expansive amount of hype behind it...how could anything go wrong?!(Cue the Blair Witch Project soundtrack...)By no means was this was the worst movie that I have ever seen, that's definitive; there were, however, a few things about the film that don't make much sense! Perhaps the most obvious among them was WTF was Mann trying to accomplish in his apparent death spiral desire to condemn all life on Earth?! He knew that the mathematics behind 'Plan A' was a fraud; so, he...obviously...believed that returning to Earth was no option. This means that it was his understanding that finding a planet suitable for life, from 'an Earth perspective', was the only viable option. Yet, he knew\believed that the ice planet that he landed on was not suitable for life, faking the data. So, why fake the data?? Would doing so enhance the likelihood of him being rescued? Presumably, yes, since he was transmitting the fake favorable data in hopes that someone would arrive & save him. Yet, he prevented them from doing anything on his world...obviously...because he knew they would uncover his deception. So, given that, what was the plan!? To condemn all life on Earth?! Granted, maybe that's the whole point of that story arc; he was insane. Which is, I believe, rather ironic; that 'death spiral', specifically due to the action of that scene, was, I think, the best scene in the entire film.Something overlooked by, at least, virtually everyone that saw this film, no doubt about it, is: Did the scientists on Earth see the blackhole, ""Gargantuan"", on the Earth-side of the wormhole, obviously, 'before' sending the astronauts through the wormhole, including the 12 sent through initially? It is implied that they did; but, ..& someone, please, correct me if I am wrong, ..no where throughout the first hour, or so, of the film did they bother to mention that blackhole that's on the other side of the wormhole, in that 'galaxy far, far away...' They talked about the 'wormhole'; not the blackhole! If they knew about the blackhole early enough, this, reasonably, may have changed their game-plan. Further, why go down to that planet, in orbit around the blackhole, when the risk of failure is so high, let alone actually retrieving data that is worth the risk of going down to that planet is so excruciatingly, 'astronomically' and exponentially low¿? Especially given the reality that said planet is completely inhospitable...given its close proximity to a blackhole¡!¡ For cryin' out loud, they'd be better off sending down a probe, at least at first, on the same quicker trajectory that they took to get to the planet, to determine if the data can be retrieved; & the data could reasonably be retrieved with just a probe, anyway! And if the time dilation makes all of that not viable, then, it is damn sure not worth sending people down there! It is a story arc that, in theory, sounds great 'script-wise'; because, it adds emotional turmoil for the characters to go through & experience &, therefore, tension & drama for the viewer - yet, it just doesn't honestly work. You see this as a person just watching the movie.I actually feel sorry for Getty, from ""That 70's Show""; while the character is not useless, it is a weak character, entirely because of how the character was introduced, & Topher Grace, as an accomplished actor, deserves better than that. It actually made sense for that character to be a doctor working for/at NASA/NORAD, at the compound, perhaps as the physician working directly with Professor Brand...File that under "" *Duh!* ""; seriously, put that into the '"" *Duh!* "" File'!Obviously, this was a much better way to introduce that character. And, obviously, they chose to not do this; they introduced the character in, pretty much, the worst way possible; dropping him in out of no where, like he fell out of the sky - literally, ..as an after-thought! This was an absolute hatchet job and, undeniably, is the worst thing about the entire film. And, of course, there's the gratuitously predictable 'Tom', a character as devoid of a legitimate reason to exist as any such character has ever existed in the history of cinema! I am actually surprised that they didn't make him an addict of some sort; why not just poor on the vulgar borishness like it's pancake syrup!¿?!And, finally, (astronaut) Brand had a much greater chance of getting back to ""Sol""/""Terra"", our Solar System, than Cooper 'the guy who fell into a black hole...'... But, they can't allow the hero to FAIL; so, they have them accomplish the completely impossible. And the 'Tesseract Scene' is awesome; it looks very cool. However, it only made sense in a 'goofy romanticized sort of way', i.e., 'script-wise', that Cooper was 'the ghost' who started it all... And although there may have been no truly good way, at least none that they were able to think of (Although, did they even try!?), to depict it cinematically, I would love to have seen something of the 5th Dimension beings who made it all possible. When Cooper said that 'we' were them, i.e., ""...they're not beings, they're us."", i.e., that humans are the 5th Dimension beings, that's just more romanticized BS.Overall, the worst thing about this movie is the directing, by far! This movie actually made me lose some degree of respect for Christopher Nolan."

" One viewing may not suffice
",codickerson,10 November 2014,"I saw this opening night (Thursday). I wanted the full monty. That means IMAX (I drove across town to get it). Wow! There are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go (or more). The first was 2001 A Space Odyssey. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Avatar come to mind for now. This was such a spectacle with a very complex script I'll admit I left the theater with a lot of questions. I knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience, I just couldn't fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. I write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later (No IMAX). OMG! I loved this movie even more tonight than four days ago. For me at least, it took two viewings for the grandeur of this project to reveal its power and intellectual reach. This is a science fiction film for the ages!"
" Gem of a Movie!
",Vishnu_nair,14 November 2014,"Interstellar, Another feather in Nolan's cap, This movie is surely one of the Nolan's finest blend, it had everything that makes you glued to the seats and those nail biting moments I can watch it again and have the same feeling as watching it for the first time, and don't be fooled by some idiots claiming that the movie is way too technical and you need to brush up your Physics before watching the movie, don't fall for this bullshit, the movie is clear and concise and well not to mention but just like any other Nolan movie this one also leaves much to your interpretation and I believe that's what makes the movies of Nolan stand out from others, it's all about IMAGINATION with a good bit of science and what could very well be a reality, I don't want to spoil it for you by revealing any interesting parts of the movie, I would recommend the movie to anyone who loves watching fiction movies that makes you believe in the fiction they portray, yes we are far from the reality, but when you are in there watching this movie, those 3 hours you become a part of the movie and it becomes the reality, few movies have given me such experience in the past, and this one definitely tops the chart!"
" Boring Hollywood SOAP OPERA
",baberchik,13 November 2014,"I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!"
" Good Directors do not (necessarily) make good writers
",vincent-27,31 December 2018,"Some directors can pull of the feat of writing and directing, Tarantino comes to mind. PT Anderson is another. Even though this was co-written between Christopher Nolan and his brother, the Coens they are not!This movies is a perfect example of how making a movie (as my amateur film maker friend put it) is like building a cathedral. Being good at making stain glass does not make you a good brick layer, and that task is best left to ones who know what they are doing. To whit, we have this monstrous piece of pretentious drivel which attempts, as so many big hollywood movies do, to gloss over hastily written sequences with flash and bombast. This is another movie that feels like it was written by a committee of executives who were barely aware of the history of film and watched a couple of youtube videos on The Grand Unified Theory and tried to write something all smart-like. This movie is so scattered and convoluted it's hard to begin, and many other reviewers have pointed a lot of the plot elements that are glossed over with yet another ""yeah, that happened, deal with it"". Here are some of the things that I audibly groaned over:Why not explain what happened to Earth when every other part of this movie is explained like the audience is 5 years old?If the technology is available to build spacecraft with cryogen chambers, how about producing new forms of food? Lab grown meat for example? Hydroponic greenhouses etc?Why are the robots basically mechanical jenga pieces? How does that design make sense? The robot REALLY bothered me, especially how there was absolutely no effort to actually make it sound like a robot, it basically sounded like exactly what it was, which most of the time was just a guy inside a cheap plastic box. His voice didn't even sound like it was coming out of a speaker. HAL sounded like a person, but still had a creepy quality to him that sounded vaguely artificial (""what a moment, wait a moment"").And then there is the idea that you could actually get anywhere near a black hole (let alone wormhole) with relatively recent technology and survive. I have a rudimentary understanding of physics, but even I know that the radiation would turn you into goo pretty fast, space suit or no space suit.And a guy waits in a spaceship for 23 years by himself and doesn't go insane and looks basically the same except for a few grey hairs in his beard? I could go on and on....This movie tries really, really hard, there is a lot of balling actors showing off their chops and trusting that they are making a masterpiece, which I imagine every actor must do, but alas there is no saving this movie. It tried too hard to be all things, part 2001: A Space Odyssey, part Armageddon, part Inception and fails on all counts. Everything about this movies hints at greatness, the effects, the Phillip Glass like score written by Hans Zimmer, the tears swelling up at climactic scenes, but it is all empty packing around a bad story. This movie is a shiny car with hamsters on a wheel as the engine.One positive outcome of this movie is that it has reminded me to read about physics out of interest, but not to discuss them like I know anything, as I will come across as pretentious as this movie.I suggest everyone watches 2001 to cleanse their pallet and to be reminded of what truly great film making is about."

" Lame-o!
",mowasteph,18 November 2014,"Here's its 2 stars...I saw it in IMAX so I enjoyed going through the wormhole. Other than that? Well, let's get started...It's so typical - almost clichéd! - the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. Interstellar is a prime example of this. It just might be the definitive example.I'm not going to go into the science much because I'm a tad science- and space-illiterate but even I could see glaring holes in this tripe. For one thing, what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile- high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? Why weren't drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? That corn looked pretty green to me, didn't you think so? What's going on in London or Montreal or Buenos Aires or anywhere other than Kansas? Is Kansas the last place anyone is? Can't the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? Why is NASA housed inside the Bonaventure Hotel? (okay sorry, I'm from LA and recognized it right away)Did Matt Damon owe someone a role and that's why he's in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? Why weren't Matthew M's grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? Who the hell cast Matthew M in this? How was it possible to relay ""tapes from loved ones at home"" across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? What was up with that stupid robot?Okay, forgetting science and crazy-ass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eye-rolling. Remember that notoriously stupid moment in Armageddon when Liv Tyler screams ""That my father up there!""? Well the entire ""human"" aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. What was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight, highly scientific, awe-at-the-majesty-of-the-universe, harsh reality sci-fi film that didn't insult you at every turn instead of this z-grade soap opera with neat-o visuals?"
" Nolan does an Armageddon
",vikascoder,7 November 2014,"SPOILER FREE BEGINS *********I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics.Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about ""Gravity""s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an ""Inception"" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon.SPOILER FREE ENDS ********Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the ""Aliens"" or ""They"" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work (""Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills (""oh we lost so many years"").And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell.And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it ""Original""? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground.And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore.I don't think even the fanboys can save this one."
" ABSOLUTE Over-hyped TOSH
",80sHorror,21 February 2015,AM I THE ONLY ONE ON PLANET EARTH WHO THINKS THAT THIS FILM IS ABSOLUTE TOSH? Perhaps I'm being unkind because I could only handle an hour before walking out. I thought the acting in particular was very poor. The storyline is twaddle - a farmer with flight experience finds NASA in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save Earth - a typecast Michael Caine (thank goodness it wasn't Morgan Freeman) opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket!. It seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? The time element is misused and the special effects are not that great. I thought Elysium knocked socks off this film. I did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that I walked ................ very quickly out of the cinema.

" A sci-fi epic
",grantss,24 November 2014,
" Overrated. Total waste of idea.
",marbl-1,26 September 2017,"Although the idea is simple and written 100 times in SF novels and short stories, it could make a quite good space opera. It could be deep and wise. It could make people think. But no. It had to be wasted. The weakest point is not poor acting (by the way: McConaughey really can't speak? I am not the best in the world in English, but I know many native speakers who couldn't understand him talking), awful music. Even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. It is a forced, painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny, childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic.It would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas, so just a few of them. Some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in IMDb FAQ, but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. I start with a biggest problem: - In R. E. Raspe's ""Baron Munchausen"", the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out, on his own hair. The Earthmen in the movie do the same: the humans from the future save their ancestors. But if the present people perish, there are no future people to save them... The most simple paradox, and yet they included it in the ""serious"" movie. And no naive explanations (branches, interpretations, non-linear timelines etc) can make it wiser, no matter how many times they use the word ""fractal"". And if the future people exist, they don't need to do anything, do they? - The best plan from the future humans is to put (in a past) a wormhole, 2 years flight from Earth, making it almost impossible to find and reach. Then the Earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. I would simply help the Earthmen get a decent crops...A catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. How? During just several years? And all plants are dead? All animals? But humans survived? How? Isn't it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? Why nobody even tries to do anything? - Why an anti-science education? A science never does any harm. Only the politics and businessmen do, using science. So it is not the science to be ostracized.A farmer drives his children to anti-science school fully equipped to bring a military drone down (has a specially programmed computer, antennas, means to establish a connection, etc.) - A ""ghost"" communication is very implausible. Does it really depend on gravity? Even some waves, oscillations would create observed effects on books/dust, the gravity hardly could.Barely legal NASA base, hidden in a barn, building a spaceship... Funny. Unsuccessfully looking for it's best pilot in the world, year after year... Funny. The pilot accidentally finds them, and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists - funny. The scientists are pilot's old friends. And they just finished building a rocket. He has never seen this ship, he is a farmer for 20 years now, so will he fly it, the only hope for humanity, please? FUNNY! - Plan A and B. Science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey, and rise them to get humans, can not rise a radish on Earth (nor perform a MRI scan).Please, stop the stupid ""expert's presentation how it works"" (the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes, just like the similar imbecile in ""The Martian"" explaining the trivial maneuver around Earth). What makes it even more pathetic, the ""expert"" addresses his childish show to a engineer and best NASA pilot....and so on... I don't understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system, on its planets (the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep, the frozen, solid clouds in the air, the anti-logic movements of the ships, the anti-logic decisions of the crew... and so on...and at the end I (and all the nearby watchers) couldn't believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughter's bookshelves. It was... it was... unspoken. And the Future Men felt that the best way of communication with Present People is to shake the books in some girls' bedroom. If you can move the book, or a hand of the watch - that means, you can move objects - you can take a pen and write as well. It is the same action, using the same forces. Yes, I fully understand the meanings, metaphors, 11 dimensions of continuum, and so on. Doesn't help.To sum up: Interstellar is just another pseudoscience-fiction movie. It is intended to be deep and serious, but is just funny (including it's makers argumentation why it is not). It is not easy to think out a GOOD SF story. You can easily make a non-science fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch (like Star Wars), but it cannot pretend it is serious and science-based. The most depressing thing about that movie is, however, it's huge overrating on IMDb. Are the young people so easy to control? If they see something that makes the first impression of having some value (slow, grave, pseudo-intellectual) they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deep-thinking? Is that why poor SF movies get such a high notes? Passengers, the last few Aliens and so on?My ""4"" rating is a real one, not lowered to balance the general overrating."
" beautiful journey
",dhruvbehl24,10 November 2014,"One of the best sci-fi movies.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater. Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade. Just go for it, without a second thought."
" Don't believe the hype
",indiedavid,7 November 2014,"""Interstellar"" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up."

" Decent Visuals but very lazy story telling...
",majoreasy,11 November 2014,"Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?) Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.) Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below!1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did.2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent.3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work.4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. ) 5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?) The above really killed the movie for me.Sidenotes:A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.) B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done.C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away?D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.) Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale.I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again."

",4friedchickensandacoke,7 March 2023,"In 1968 countless theatre goers walked out of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey. Should have won Best Picture. And here in 2014 IMDb is giving Interstellar an 8.6 rating . I found this latest film over the top unbelievable! And incredibly silly. The top cast did give a good performance, but felt the acting of both Michael Cain and Matt Dillon not worthy of this script. The entire third act was choreographed wonderfully but again unbelievable and extremely hard to follow.168 minutes was also much too long ., could have been edited to 2 hours . I do give creedance to Christopher Nolan his eye to detail, and didn't include audio to outside space travel, just as Stanley Kubrick did for his Space Opera 50 years before, but the overall audience didn't buy that film eithe.Sorry. I give a 6 rating ."
" Must see. 10/10 film!
",GeorgeStrCy89,3 October 2023,"I wanted to write a review for this movie for awhile and after watching it again last night I made up my mind.Currently at #23 film on the all-time list, it was at #30 some years ago and I just love that people are giving this film the love and respect it deserves. Many of you out there are saying The Dark Knight or Inception are Nolan's best films but for me Interstellar is the best. Don't get me wrong because I can't name any bad Christopher Nolan film, he has to be my favorite director and with his latest movie Oppenheimer I believe he won even more fans!So now about Interstellar, from where should I begin? The score? The acting? The story? Yes, you should give the film some time, let's say half an hour! I know many people who are jumping to conclusions before the film gets to the point, but as soon as you get to the point you only wished the movie was even longer."

" Dumb, dumber, dumbest!
",max_tout,18 November 2014,"This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway .....Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around.There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then.A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy.They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible. So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it. No, no, noooo.They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there. And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes? Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan?By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh! And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh! And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned.Not Nolan.NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans.Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing.And I loved Inception!"
" Interbollo..s
",SvetoslavGrigorov,16 November 2014,"Interstellar by Christopher NollanReviewed by Svetoslav GrigorovFirst, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job).Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a ""serious"" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it ""scientific""??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her.The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens.P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know."

The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut.

The movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way. Those robots there are amazing as well, complete opposite of Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I love them. The emotional layer is as great as it gets. You may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once. Finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible. It all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the Universe encountering strangest parts of physics."
" it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have filmmakers like Nolan!
",lasttimeisaw,22 November 2014,"By no means I am a scientific geek, my days of tackling with science has been fortuitously truncated years ago, so putting aside all these heatedly discussed astrological concepts, to be specific, wormhole, black hole, tesseract, the fifth dimension and time travel relativity (thanks to the enormous contribution of Dr. Kip Thorne), INTERSTELLAR is a potent analogue of Nolan's previous stunning visual and conceptual extravaganza INCEPTION (2010, 9/10), which looks deep into the bizarre inner activity within one's dream realm, but this time, Nolan's scope is going the opposite direction, extended outwardly to the unknown universe and based on a more perceivable future of the earth's imminent doom (we are all the culprits of various degrees in this scenario), it is not just an awe-inspiring outer-space odyssey, in its dual storyline, the life on earth is phenomenally linked by human's primitive force - love. I didn't watch the film on an IMAX screen, which in Cairo is quite scarce, and Cairo is a big city, but I have no gripe to watch it on a normal 2D screen since it is fantastically overwhelming just the same. In the pre-space trip , ex-pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (McConaughey) is staying with his two children, Murph, short for Murphy (Foy) and Tom (Chalamet) with his father-in-law Donald (Lithgow), while their world is experiencing extreme weather catastrophe such as sand storms, the father-and-daughter bond between Cooper and Murph has been intensified through their similar attitude towards science and the supernatural episodes happened in Murph's room, where she claims there is a ""phantom"" using gravity to send her messages, which is such an ingenuous yet inconspicuous maneuver to foreshadows the mind-blowing twist in the black hole, and unthinkably it becomes the key to save all the humanity on earth. The emotional crunches are prepped with incredible performance, again, McConaughey is unbelievably trans-formative as the loving father who decide to reunite with Murph and keep his promises against all odds, his supreme reaction shots when reading messages for the past 23 years from Tom and Murph on earth are his Oscar-baiting moments, it seems the McConaussance has not been slowing down and one Oscar statue seems not enough at all. Mackenzie Foy plays the young Murph, Chastain is her adult version and Burstyn gives the final happy ending as the senior one. Chastain is a relentless fireball, formidably interprets the most arcane part (the telepathic revelation of who is the phantom?) which sometimes even challenges its own credibility, it is not a showy role for Chastain's caliber, nevertheless she is excellent in it, take one example, the minute facial nuances when Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) telling her the disturbing truth in his deathbed are handled with almost undetectable forbearance yet viewers can maximally sense the repercussions since it shakes all her belief in one second. Foy is equally brilliant as the young Murph, she sets a solidified base with Cooper, which sustains the mainstay of the film's critical emotional core and guides us through the transcendent experiences with Cooper, and a new child star is officially born. Hathaway's Brand, although second billed, surprisingly doesn't have too much to offer as the co-pilot, sometimes even becomes a corny nuisance (poor Wes Bentley!), there is another type of father-daughter undercurrent (she and Caine) which the film largely dodges. During Cooper's expedition to find suitable planet for earthlings, there is the punned ""Murphy's Law"" effect subsequently occurs, Matt Damon's classified cameo is well-kept from the trailer and his appearance further cements his recent string of involvement with Sci-Fi genre (after THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU 2011, 6/10, ELYSIUM, 2013, 7/10 and Terry Gilliam's THE ZERO THEOREM 2013, next year he will be in Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN with Chastain), his Dr. Mann is the revered pioneer in the project, however it is through him, Nolan builds the only real villain (arguably Caine the big fat liar is condemnable as well), who succumbs to human frailties under the extreme condition, his motive is understandable, any of us could make the same move under his condition, that's why the film is so precious, one has to overcome all the innate barriers to achieve something extraordinary, say without this commitment with Murph, without the uninhibited love for her daughter (poor Tom, his father never even mention him at all), maybe Plan B is the future for human race, and the cruelty is freshly in our face. After GRAVITY (2013, 9/10), we reach a new monumental peak for the cosmic cinematography, pairing with a new DP Hoyte Van Hoytema (from HER 2013, 8/10; TINKER TAILER SOLIDER SPY 2011, 6/10, THE FIGHTER 2010, 8/10 and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008, 9/10), Nolan's galactic wonders are sufficiently groundbreaking, the three planets they visit bear simplistic topography grafted with inconceivable excesses, and the final homeland, the distorted proportion, all evokes the striking variations in INCEPTION. And if Alfonso Cuarón can win BEST DIRECTOR for GRAVITY, Nolan is much more deserving, I am firmly standing behind Nolan's back this, it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have filmmakers like Nolan dares to make these ""impossible and grand venture"" to enlighten our imagination and edify our own consciousness as a human being in this imperfect world, with the prowess of love we all possess, however small we are individually, there is hope always beckoning, eternally."

If you do the latter, you will enjoy a Nolan's masterpiece.One of my top ten movies of all time and most likely the best sci-fi I have ever watched."
" A Over-hyped Imperfect Movie...
",dplowsav,9 November 2014,"Interstellar is not a bad film. Lets get that out of the way... Nor is it a great film either.It straddles the fence of imperfection ever so well. There are some great moments and then there are some very long drawn out moments that make you shout at the screen and say, ""Shut up already and get on with it!"" Once such scene came when Anne Hathaway was talking about love... a lot. Yes, there was a lot of talk about love and analyzing what love means. That moment sucked me out of the film, because I found it hard to be dragged into the immersive experience that Interstellar should be, when it is coupled up with such bad writing that doesn't blend in a scene well.Such out of context reality smashing moments happen a lot in Interstellar that makes you wonder if the writers were tripping out on their own interstellar experience. Another scene comes at the revealing of a betrayal, of sorts, from a certain character. Without going into too much, all I'll say is that the scene felt hammy, rushed and again, didn't blend in what was going on. While I 'get it', as in the reasons for the betrayal, I didn't 'get it' in terms of why it had to happen, and it just felt... strange.By the time the film matures in the middle, it goes downhill and your left on a spiraling out of control adventure that is the result of some new age writing gone bad.If that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the endless scenes of key dialogue that I could hardly hear, because Nolan likes to blare his music up over important dialogue. Maybe it was just the Cinema sound system being extra enthusiastic, or maybe once again, a criticism that I've aimed at Nolan before, is that he really needs to edit his movies better and get an editor that doesn't make it hard for the viewer to hear what's being said. It is blatantly criminal in the sheer bad editing that this film suffers from.The film does have its good moments, although I would have to call them rare, but again the visual effects are splendid and is possibly the only reason why this film is a 6 for me, and not a 5 or lower. There literally some scenes in the film that made me go 'wow...' and look on with delight. It's for these scenes that you need to go and watch Interstellar, but be warned, that the rest of the film performs below its expectation.Major Gripe: Time for a major gripe, and I thought it would be the editing of the film, but no. It comes down to design. Now, I've read that there are those that liked the robots, TARS, and CASE. That's fine, and I'll admit the design is unusual and somewhat funky. Yet the positive reviewers probably don't or won't, look at the faults in design. Well I saw the fault in the design all too clear; In one particular scene, just after getting out of the shuttle after landing on a new planet, TARS is scene 'walking' for want of a better word, onto the planet. Yet I caught that moment when it awkwardly tried to maintain its balance. What was it doing with its left leg? I wondered to myself... And ever since I saw that strange fault, I couldn't let it go. The more I looked at its wobbly movements and its rather awkward looking design and its very human personality with its very human non-robotic voice, I just couldn't get into it that this was a robot. I kept on imagining a guy in a suit... and that's the problem.When you design a robot for a film, you need to get it across to the audiences that this is a robot. Not some strange puppet on a string or anything else, but a robot. Sadly Nolan failed in getting this across because of the voice being used, because of the very human personality and because of the rather awkward looking way it just went about. There was nothing about the robot that I honestly liked, it just didn't feel like one, and at no time in the film is it explained where the tech came from, impressive tech at that, yet it just didn't translate well onto the screen.Interstellar is a decent film. Is it worth the prestigious rating of 9.0 that most reviewers give it? I personally don't think so, and I think in a lot of cases such positive reviews come from the reviewer being dazzled with special effects and in a lot of cases that is the case. It happened with Gravity; people were so amazed at the effects they just threw 9's at it all day. Interstellar is not about any of that, it's about the story, and sadly, it lacks a decent one."

" Could have been better
",holloway-sarahjane,9 November 2014,"Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The ""Dust Bowl"" effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many ""that wouldn't happen"" moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive."

And at the end, we realize that we as a species are responsible for our own survival. We have to work hard for our existence. We have to sacrifice everything for the greater good. Nobody is coming to save us. We have to save ourselves. We are our god. We created us and we will save us.Very deep and very extraordinary movie. It is not enough to watch it only once. A must see."
" A Film Feigning Importance
",Cinnyaste,10 November 2014,"Somewhere on the path to juxtaposing the story of the imminent death by starvation of humanity on Earth against a desperate search for a new planetary home (hopefully to not similarly despoil), the authors of ""Interstellar"" forgot to consider the audience and instead created a far too long, far too arcane and far too pet film. ""Interstellar"" is a kissin' cousin to the equally pet, pseudo mind-blowing, con man sleight-of-hand ""Inception.""A bitter taste is left in the mouth by a self-satisfied script constantly trumpeting a specialness that, alas, is not at all special.Audiences have been beat to death by the tropes, plot elements and dialogue seen so many times before. For example, the ""Pursued By Demons Retired ______ Forced Back Into Service"" trope.Women, as in most films, are relegated to the back of the bus. When will writers and filmmakers wake up to the richness in woman's hearts and minds - even a cold scientist's ticker and noggin?Face-down-death awaits the character with the fewest lines and closeup. (Much like the Bic 'Red Shirts' in ""Star Trek"" you knew would never make it to the end credits.)An intelligent young woman becomes hysterical because Daddy's leaving, yet her intellect does not grasp his mission is important: To save her and the rest of the world. Beside, Daddy didn't explain, at least not on camera.Matt Damon resurrects from hypersleep to wreak havoc as in the hackneyed ""Don't Astronauts on ""The Twilight Zone"" Pass Basic Psych Tests?"" plot element.Don't forget the Dead Wife and Wise Grandpa tropes.Wonder is non-existent. That's quite a feat as few films have led us through a wormhole. ""Black Hole"" did a better job. At least the mysterious passage in Disney's opus didn't suggest injection into a globule borrowed from the coda of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" (Also cobbed from Kubrick's masterpiece are the more human than humans (articulated) computers.)Cinematic corn served warm with a schmear of butter is quite delicious. Corn served cold by trying-too-hard actors sittin' on the porch waxin' philosophical is a dish best passed to the person sitting on your right.There are nonsensical interviews of dust storm survivors who describe what the special effects department has just shown. There's no lack of understanding why the run time is 169 minutes. The dogged determination to not self-edit and lose script pages underscores either Nolan's lack of being a good audience or not caring about audiences - the latter a quality indicative of too many contemporary filmmakers.The ending leads to head scratching that, in another film, would elicit laughs from the audience. Poltergeists my patootie!""Interstellar"" veers uncomfortably close to complete train wreck, but there are a few nice touches. While derivative, the articulated computers are cool. That mankind can solve mankind's problems without an advanced alien intelligence, God or other deus ex machina is the one original idea - and it's a good one.Save very few elements to recommend it, ""Interstellar"" is a really, really long bore pretending importance. There's nothing worse than films of that ilk."
" Stellar, Indeed!
",namashi_1,8 November 2014,"Christopher Nolan's much awaited 'Interstellar' is Stellar, Indeed! Nolan takes us to space & beyond, delivering a film that's both, astounding & futuristic. Made unfathomable ambition & force, this Sci-Fi/Family-Drama, deserves a watch for the experience it gives you as a viewer & also a human being.'Interstellar' Synopsis: A group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.'Interstellar' raises questions on the future & on what maybe the fate of mankind after all. Jonathan & Chris Nolan's Screenplay fills in all the scientific punches to lead it in, that eventually, is more a tale of a father & his daughter. 'Interstellar' proudly captures the strong bond of family-bond, that we all experience & relate too in our lives. The portions back home on earth are wonderfully executed. The Sci-Fit bit, however, is stunning & equally captivating. The twist & turns in the narrative, featuring a surprise cameo Matt Damon, only keep you guessing on what's gonna happen next. Its purely edge-of-the-seat rush.Chris Nolan's Direction is gargantuan, just like the film's scale. Nolan handles this important story with care & style. Each & Every Visual has been filmed amazingly by Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. You can't look away from the Screen for a single moment! Lee Smith's Editing is pretty crisp, despite the film's mammoth length, which goes on for more than 168-minutes. Hans Zimmer's Score is exhilarating. Visual Effects are Oscar-Worthy. Performance-Wise: Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, delivers a heartfelt performance. The Oscar-Winning Actor is the soul of this epically structured film. Anne Hathaway as Amelia, is perfect in her portrayal. Jessica Chastain as Murphy, Cooper's long suffering daughter, is splendid. Her emotional breakdowns tear you apart. Wes Bentley as Doyle, is effective. Casey Affleck as Tom, is nicely restrained. John Lithgow as Donald, is subtly funny. Michael Caine as Professor Brand, is dignified, as ever. On the whole, 'Interstellar' is not merely a film, its an Experience. Heavily Recommended!"

" Not The Film I Expected By A Long Shot
",james1844,8 November 2014,"The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed ""overkill"" of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts. I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion."
" You either love it or hate it.
",turneredgar,2 February 2021,"This is the first film with several flaws that I still rate a 10. Strictly scientifically speaking, it bends or breaks several laws of physics. So if you are a stickler for scientific accuracy, this ain't your movie. But, if you can look past the physics, you are in for a magical adventure. Otherwise get you some Jane Austen and call it a day."

" Possibly the best Sci-fi story ever told, in my consideration, the best sci-fi movie ever, which i've watched countless times!
",marveller-66,1 June 2021,"The title pretty much covers it all up. Christopher Nolan's absolution, a living legend in filmmaking. Watched the movie about a couple of years ago...no about 3 years ago, if i recall precisely. It's not just the fact that it has an amazing set-up/world-building, story-telling and an unbelievable story, this movie really hits deep in the human hearts. I envy those who've experienced this masterpiece at the Cinemas back in 2014. Heck i even got so obsessed with Black Holes that i learned so much about 'em.Detailed score:
(Story-99) (Direction-97) (Soundtrack & score-100)
(Performances-94) (Cinematography-96)
(Visuals-98) (Total score : 9.8/10)In summary, possibly the best Science-fiction movie in the history of Cinema, imo."

" ""Interstellar"" is everything you can expect from a motion picture and beyond
",851222,9 November 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Interstellar"" to simply put, is a magnificent motion picture. It is a close call masterpiece (surely a classic). The whole hype wasn't just a hype, it's true, and you have to witness it on the big screen to truly appreciate it. It has everything a true sci- fi movie should have and everything that a truly great motion picture must have. Everything here works on the highest level. The music (without doubts, a locked Oscar nomination), sound / sound effects (two possible Oscar winners), acting, directing, script special effects (a sure nominee) are a top notch, and combined with realistic sci-fi ideas, this movie is must see. It has to go down as one of (if not THE) very best science fiction movies off all times.Overall, ""Interstellar"" is as good as movies goes. It has everything to held you glued to the screen for almost 3 hours, but trust me, watching ""Interstellar"" you will be delivered to a movie magic without a wormhole help."
" Astronomy and physics good – Terrible storyline – full of the black holes!
",mnoble1-2,21 January 2015,"Science Fiction is not an excuse for lazy writing and sloppy direction.Starts off showing flowing fields of thriving green vegetation – constantly bombarded by massive dust storms and yet continues to grow and thrive. Then, we are supposed to believe that a drone – one that can fit in the back of a pickup truck has enough solar cells to power 'an entire farm.'After that, Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan (Screenplay) expect us to believe that a retired NASA pilot, who never left Earth orbit and survived crashing his orbital spacecraft, is more experienced to go on an interstellar voyage than the astronauts that have studied and prepared for the voyage. Okay, I'll admit this one is possible, but not likely.The first planet they decide to visit – the one so close to a black hole it has significant time dilation – the one covered in water and deluged with huge waves every hour, (one of which destroyed the original exploration spacecraft and killed the pilot – not detected by the spacecraft instruments, by the way) is a prime candidate for colonization.Then, when the next huge wave arrives, Christopher Nolan (Director) makes us watch as one of the astronauts stands by the spacecraft door for several seconds (plenty of time to get in the spacecraft) watching the wave approach and is washed away. Why did he stand around waiting outside the spacecraft in the first place! Nonsensical!The next thing the Nolan brothers expect us to believe is that an astronaut who volunteered for what was probably a one-way mission suddenly goes crazy, becomes a coward, falsifies data, and turns into a murderer! Were his rescuers going to leave him on the planet to die after they found out the planet was uninhabitable! Don't think so!Later, this same coward astronaut decides to take a chance and risk his life opening the spacecraft hatch after warnings that doing so would cause a blowout. I guess we supposed to believe he is that crazy!"

" Brainy, Ballsy, and Beautiful to Behold
",DareDevilKid,16 November 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsChristopher Nolan has reached deep into the stars to tell a story about mankind's demise and refusal to go quietly into the night. Here is a director whose name has, quite literally, become synonymous with realism. The Nolanisation of cinema, which made the gloomy streets of Gotham a bridge between the fantastical and the commonplace, now grounds countless fancies within the mud of our reality. With ""Interstellar"", Nolan inverts expectation once again, with a film rooted in the regularity of mathematics homework but spliced with the fantastic. The film charts a course in the latest theories in quantum physics and other space-related sciences to tell a story that engages and entertains viewers. It also goes to exacting lengths to meticulously depict the theory of relativity — vetted by executive producer and renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne.Opening, on a dusty model of the shuttle Atlantis, the film's near- future setting sees humanity starving and devoid of hope. Eking out an existence in a post-millennial Dust Bowl, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his two children lead a life of agrarian survivalism. But in Cooper we find a new man cut from old cloth - an all-American hero. Played with a drawling, Texan swagger underpinned by startling emotional depth, he is Nolan's most traditional lead to date, embodying the wide-eyed wonder of the Director's youth; a man for whom we are ""explorers and pioneers, not caretakers"", who casts his lot among the stars as the human race's last, best hope.With the ailing Blue Planet left behind, Interstellar shifts smoothly into second gear. According to ""Interstellar's"" on-board astrophysicist, Kip Thorne, the spherical wormhole (it's three- dimensional, obviously) and the spinning event horizon of the film's black hole (named Gargantua) are mathematically modeled and true to life. Sitting before a 100-foot screen, though, you won't give a toss about equations because Nolan's starscape is the most mesmerizing visual of the year. Gargantua is as captivating as it is terrible: an undulating maelstrom of darkness and light; this is space imagined with a dizzying immensity.Nolan grounds his epic tale through the relationship between humans. There is a scene in the movie that shifts from deep space back to Earth, from a father (McConaughey) who hasn't aged much physically to a daughter(Chastain) all grown up. The difference captured in this moment was everything Cooper feared about leaving his heartland farm, son and daughter, for a last-gasp mission to find an inhabitable planet for Earth's population.Thankfully, Nolan's helped no end by his lead, the charismatic McConaughey cementing his A-list comeback with a powerful performance that helps ground the grand proceedings and provides the film with its emotional core. Among all the space phenomena and alien terrains, it's his quieter moments that provides the film's small-scale highlights. It's also his back-and-forth banter with TARS – a former military droid with a fiercely caustic artificial intelligence (voiced by comedian Bill Irwin) – that lends the film some much needed humor amidst the solemnity of the mission at hand. Meanwhile, Nolan newbie, Chastain, and regular collaborator, Caine, provide solid Earthbound support with only fairly limited screen- time, and Hathaway adds a refreshingly down-to-earth presence to the outer-space adventure.For Nolan faithfuls, all his signature notes are also present: Michael Caine imparts wisdom in front of a blackboard, the story skips through time without a fade to black, Hans Zimmer provides a haunting score, and multiple action sequences are cut together in a frenetic crescendo. If there's one area that Nolan is visibly more comfortable with, it's tense, super-sized set pieces – and he more than delivers here. From a race against a giant, skyscraper-sized wave to some frosty fisticuffs atop a herculean glacier (meticulously shot to frame the combatants as tiny ants compared to the enormity of the icy mass they're traversing), ""Interstellar"" contains its fair share of heart-in-mouth moments.The production design is more ""Alien"" than ""Star Trek"", with a grimy, functional spacecraft reaching murky, yet beautifully conceived new worlds. New cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytemer, more than ably replaces Nolan's regular DOP, Wally Pfister. The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of ""Interstellar"" admirably and charmingly low-key. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes, while the film's tech – taking cues from films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien"" – has a tangible, old-school quality to it, from the embryonic, sous-vide-style hyper-sleep chambers to McConaughey's clunky, faceless robot sidekick TARS. Even in the depths of new galaxies, characters still write out their trajectories on white boards and explain scientific theories using pen and paper. Ditto the movie itself, shot on film in good old- fashioned 2D. It's to Nolan and his visual effects team's credit, though, that he's still able to push boundaries despite this traditional approach: ""Interstellar"" contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive, and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen.""Interstellar"" poses all the right questions and provides some highly cerebral answers to most of them, while leaving the others rightfully unanswered. This is Nolan at his highest-functioning but also his least accessible; a film that eschews conflict for exploration, action for meditation and reflection. For the first time, Nolan opens his heart as well as his mind. Never hitherto a comfortably emotional filmmaker, here he demonstrates a depth of feeling not present in his earlier work. ""Interstellar"" is a wish to re-instill the wonder of the heavens in a generation for whom the only space is cyber. Anchored in the bottomless depths of paternal love, it's a story about feeling as much as thinking.As a light-year-spanning quest to save the human race, this is the director's broadest canvas by far, but also his most intimate. And against the alien backdrop of black holes, wormholes, and strange new worlds, ""Interstellar"" stands as Nolan's most human film to date."
" A potentially great film but.....
",g-hbe,27 May 2018,"...ruined by almost indecipherable speech, especially on the part of Cooper. We chose this film as it had received good reviews and we like a good science fiction film, but within the first ten minutes we knew we were in for a 'what did he say' -fest. The actor playing Cooper had such mumbled, lazy diction and spoke in a semi whisper it was almost impossible to understand anything he said. About an hour in we almost decided to give up and watch an old 60's Doris Day & Rock Hudson comedy instead - at least you can hear every word clear as a bell. But we struggled through all 2.5 hours of it and came out the other end none the wiser.
Do they go somewhere to learn how to mangle their speech? Or maybe they have their jaws wired?"
" Very good but a bit overrated
",jmartinvos,2 July 2021,"Pro's:
Actually no sound in space finally, very well done.Atmosphere of the desolate and loneliness have been captured perfectly.Big fan of the soundtracks
Overall good acting, only the protagonist didn't fit too well for me
Nice idea and story.Con's:
Predictability. The ghost and the meeting at the end with a very old murphy were both pretty obvious to come 2/3 into the movie.Also how the heck did the dad get out of the black hole."
" Interesting and visually stunning...but I just couldn't get invested in the story.
",RevRonster,10 November 2014,"I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's work and was really excited to see ""Interstellar."" While the film started very strong and was loaded with emotional promise, the story just lost me and I quickly found myself growing bored with it.Yes, the film is visually stunning, Matthew McConaughey is awesome in his role, and the film has some very entertaining robots that provide some light-hearted and cool moments, the story's emotional impact was lost due to Nolan showing off how much he knew about science and time. While what we are presented with is interesting and neat to learn, they weren't presented in a way I felt was meshing with the story. They felt more like intermissions where the story is stopped and the audience is forced to pull out their textbooks to learn about what is going to happen. It felt like Nolan was stopping the emotional course of the story to show you all how hard he knows science.And while I loved McConaughey in the film, I felt a lot of the performances weren't coming close to what he was brining. Heck, even some of the characters come off as superfluous as they lack any real depth and feel tacked on in order to achieve the next plot device—for example, the surprise addition of a well known actor comes off as a needless villain that did little to really create tension and felt like something that was thrown in at the last minute.I still really enjoy Nolan's work and will forever admit that the visuals were gorgeous and McConaughey was very enjoyable in the film—and yes, I will say that all the science Nolan drops on us is very intriguing and cool but, in the end, I just couldn't invest myself in the story. It starts very strong but once the story took to the stars and traveling through black holes, the emphasis went from deep emotion to deep thought and that hurt the overall presentation for me. Science is pretty awesome but I just didn't see a balance of getting the human factor and the academic factor right. They didn't seem to gel and that kept me from getting fully invested in the journey to save the human race.Hello! The name is Rev. Ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, bad jokes, geek references, and other movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at ""Interstellar"" and other films that can instantly get the ears of Neil deGrasse Tyson to perk up) you can visit my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com.

" A graceful duet of Sci-Fi and Reality
",jackfull,18 September 2018,"Interstellar is a masterpiece of both visuals, science fiction, reality, and story. What makes this movie so good to people, is the fact of how everything is executed. 
The camera work and visuals in Interstellar use both CGI and real word environments. The water planet was not a stage, but actually a glacier in Iceland. The combination of visuals with the props, costumes, etc. are what make this film look so breathtaking. 
The Sci Fi aspect of Interstellar comes mostly into affect when Joesph Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) enters a black hole in the final minutes of the movie. This sends him to what can only be described as a different dimension, that has the ability to bridge both space and time. The nickname for this dimension (but only because it appears in a way Coop can understand and use it) is the space bookcase. The bookcase is the one in his daughter Murph's bedroom. It's here that he can see that the coordinates and things that were laid out for him on Murph's floor to get him into space in the first place was laid out for him, by him. This would constitute as a time loop, but while Interstellar does involve theoretical time physics in its plot, it does not dabble with time travel as a whole concept. This part of the movie is what falls into the Sci Fi genre, in that we don't know if something like this could actually happen. 
The Reality aspect of Interstellar actually involves most of the film as a whole. Most of the science and equations used in it are in fact, real world science. 
Lastly, the story. The story is well written, the dialogue is great, and it defines each character so that each person has their own traits and quirks. 
All in all, everything in this movie gets wrapped up into the beautiful work that is Interstellar. I would strongly suggest this movie, in that it makes you think just a little bit more."
" Wow
",siandreww,1 September 2021,"I wish I could watch this film again for the first time. I thought it would be more confusing but all was explained very well. One of the best films ever made no doubt I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the acting, casting, plot and score are divine unbeatable in its genre. I can't wait to watch it again."
" Speechless masterpiece!
",aleksandra-yakubenko,12 November 2014,"I have never in my life experienced such an emotional brake as I did today watching Interstellar! I left theatre shaking violently, crying and having I think 150 BPM. Every single piece of the movie from the story itself, visuals, music and acting is a perfect combination and perfection. I even can't find right word to give you proper review (partly because English is not my native)and summarization won't give the movie justice. The only thing I regret that I watched it dubbed (though in my country dubbing is really good) I advice t go see the movie alone on yourself as I did and it will pull you in from the first frame to this epic journey!P.S. Oscars to Nolan and the movie right away!"
" Finally, I found the answer 🙂
",poribrajok,20 August 2020,"Well, I will be very brief. I found the answer of one of the most difficult questions: ""What is your favourite movie?"" For me it was one of the toughest questions 'coz there was a time I watched like 100 movies on an average per month. And I'm so glad to finally find the answer and thanks Mr. Nolan for that. I can easily give 10 stars to the movie only for introducing me to the concept of five dimensions. For other aspects of the movie, I wish I could give the movie a 11 or 12 out of 10!"
" An Emotional Intersteller Journey
",brandonbyrnes-91372,15 November 2022,"I find myself watching this film atleast once a year since it came out, and every time I'm blown away by it. I used to be a HUGE movie junkie, watching atleast 2 movies every single day but as my life has gotten busier I've migrated over to YouTube the home of short attention spans. Nowadays I maybe watch 2 or 3 movies a month and rarely watch something I've seen before but this here is the kind of movie that deserves a rewatch, and another and another. If you've never seen this, which would be weird since it came out almost 9 years ago, then you are in for a treat, granted it will be a bit of a depressing treat but a treat none the less."
" Don't believe the hype, the pedigree
",brucecsnow,3 April 2023,"A decent movie with a lot of production values and star power but at the end is just too surrealistic. You'll hear all the usual imdb rants: magnificent, a triumph, a masterpiece but its all overblown. Slowing a movie down making it mysterious and putting the stakes so high only gets you so far.The movies starts well and who can't get enough of Anne Hathaway's gorgeous face but like the heralded soundtrack after a while it is overhelming.Not every Christopher Nolan movie is a masterpiece from frame to frame. Not every action or lack of action has earth shattering consequence. Sometime its just a highly produced and directed movie that should of had a fresh pair of eyes look at the script before it went into production."
" A hundred years later..
",cool_jojo_007,4 July 2022,"This movie will be considered as a must watch for everyone. Amongst the top 3 of all time. In terms of a visual spectacle, it is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen this already, you are missing out something essential in your life."
" A Relative Matter
",aharmas,5 November 2014,"Nolan does it again. He gives us a thought-provoking adventure with basis on the past, present, and possible future of humankind. It makes us ponder about how we came about, where and why we are experiencing the current state of affairs, and the possible outcome. Who is responsible for humankind's future? Who do we relate to and why? Are there any ""they"" out there to guide, help, protect us, or send us to our ultimate fate.""Interstellar"" follows the journey of a man who is selected to find a possible solution to our dying environment. He stumbles upon a secret, scientific project that might take him to another galaxy where he can find a suitable answer to our problems. What he is told, what happens, and what the others do is what makes the tale so interesting and exciting. However, this is not ""Star Wars"" or ""Close Encounters"". It is a original idea that goes beyond what others have hinted at before. What if we dared crossed that border? What if we pushed ourselves a little more? Where does the spiritual and the scientific intersect? Of course, there will be questions about theology, though we hardly hear the characters make any direct references to such entities, but we have a wonderful score that certainly reminds us of what is not being said.In order to get our interests, the outline is laid out, and Cooper (Matthew) is soon on his way to Saturn and the wormhole that will serve as a conduit to the other galaxy where there will be more choices and answers to our questions. Unfortunately, there might not be enough time to deal with the possibilities, and that is where the problem lies. On top of that, there are always surprises along the way, and both nature itself and human nature have a way of coming up with more variables than we care to deal with.Soon the pilot and scientists see themselves in worlds where both gravity, time, and energy take on different manifestations from what we are used to. Some storms are just much bigger and powerful than what we are accustomed to, and there is always hidden agendas, unexpected twists to the story, and our ability to try our hardest when things become really complicated.I truly enjoyed the way some natural events and emotions are explained in very detailed scientific lingo, which might prove fresh to some and too challenging to other members of the audience. What strikes me, too is that though the film appears to slow down for some of these exchanges, it never becomes boring. There is always the lure of mystery, of knowledge, and how the mind is thirsty for some sort of stimulation, and in this film, knowledge is power and salvation, and I found it invigorating and hopeful that books are prominently displayed here.We can see how technology allows Nolan to create a new series of visual and sound effects, which play an important part here, and it is very satisfying to see that space looks ""real"", and by the time we are taken through the wildest moments of the ride, we are not disappointed. In fact, the climax of the film is even more complex than expected because here is where technology, faith, and the will to survive blend quite nicely. Nolan keeps his characters real, even when it becomes more challenging to believe there is the possibility of another level to the way we understand the word ""dimension"".All of the performers do excellent work here, with Jessica and Matthew leading the pack. Caine, Burstyn, Hathaway and Damon do very good supporting work, and each one does his/her best to make the story's difficult parts believable and relatable. There is not going to be anyone in the audience who will not believe the way the laws of physics and biology are pushed to the limit because the structure of the film is very intelligent, never going beyond what we understand, and if still a bit incomprehensible, at least it lays the foundations for what might be a more concrete possibility in the future.""Interstellar"" will have you thinking, believing, and loving every minute those people are on the screen. We have a little bit of everything, and the balances are just right because even a power emotion like love is somehow explained in a logical way that will have skeptics believing that it is as real anything that scientists can fabricate in a lab. ""Interstellar"" shows another side of Science Fiction, making it more tangible, more real, more heartfelt, and way different from what we have seen before."
" Mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's brain and Malick's beauty
",Pavan_Daggupati,7 November 2014,
" The Peak of Science Fiction
",seyfettingecit,6 November 2023,"""Interstellar"" proves that science fiction can be packed with not only visual effects, but also deep thought. The film boldly tackles scientific concepts and concepts. It conveys complex topics such as the bending effects of time and the theory of relativity to the audience in an understandable way.However, ""Interstellar"" is not only a scientific lesson but also an emotional journey. The main character Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) relationship with his family and his bond with his daughter Murph (played by Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn) are touched upon touchingly throughout the film. This makes the film not just brain-burning sci-fi, but a story imbued with universal themes such as human togetherness, sacrifice and love.Visually, ""Interstellar"" delivers breathtaking scenes. Journeys into deep space and alien planets create unforgettable moments in cinema history. Hans Zimmer's music makes the film even more impressive.In conclusion, ""Interstellar"" is a masterpiece of both science fiction and cinematic art. Christopher Nolan's directorial talents, the performances of the cast, and the deep themes covered in the film offer viewers an unforgettable experience. After watching this movie, you may start thinking about the secrets of the universe."
" Big, loud, and overloaded with a lot of emotional baggage . . .
",The_Film_Cricket,11 November 2014,"If we learned anything last year from Gravity it is that when dealing with movies based on science fact, less is more. Christopher Nolan might have taken some of that to heart with his new space adventure Interstellar. Here is a movie with infinite science and infinite filmmaking skill, but it weighs so heavily on an over-melodramatic bid for the soul of humanity that after three hours we find ourselves too exhausted to care.The story, at its core, is a good one. We're sometime in the near-future when the planet Earth is essentially on life-support (Al Gore will love this movie), suffering a resurgence of the dustbowl as our crops are drying up and humanity has regressed into an agrarian state. Amid this breakdown we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a good-hearted former aeronautical engineer-turned-farmer who is raising a son named Tom, and a daughter named Murphy (if you forget that name, rest assured that Cooper will repeat it at least 300 times before the movie is over).During a massive dust storm, Cooper and Murphy find themselves the recipients of a sign in binary that is either a message from ghosts, God or space aliens. In doing the math, Cooper finds himself among officials at the remains of NASA, and quickly assigned to travel into space, navigate through a worm hole and find another habitable planet to sustain mankind. His crew includes a mournful co-pilot named Brand (Anne Hathaway), a physicist named Romilly (David Dyasi); and a geographer named Doyle (Wes Bentley). Also, two robots named CASE and TARS, who look like monoliths and move like spiders. Actually CASE and TARS are the best things in the movie. They look like the kiosk that you buy your movie tickets from, but they break into smaller parts to perform rudimentary functions –they're really quite impressive.Through a plot that gets way too complicated, the crew find themselves on the other side of the galaxy where they realize that one hour on the new planet equals seven years on Earth. That leads to emotional crises on Cooper's part because he's the one member of the crew with kids back home. Time and relative space begin to spin and bend and twist until neither the crew nor the audience can figure what the heck is going on. This is a very complex story, one that I admit I struggled to follow (and I was able to follow Inception).You find yourself having to look amid large chunks of story to find the main narrative. When you get there you find that through all the gargantuan special effects, music and sound effects, Intersteller is really the story of the disconnection between Cooper and Murphy. Cooper knows that when he gets back home that his daughter will be all grown up (and played by Jessica Chastain) so his mission is really just an effort to make things right. That leads to a long, VERY long scenes in which Cooper mourns the fact that he'll never get to watch his little girl grow up. That would be fine except that the movie belabors the point for nearly three hours, playing the same overemotional notes over and over. Not to be heartless, but when traveling to the other side of the universe, I really could care less about a weepy little girl back home.Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers. He is the one director working right now who really wants to put his vision on screen rather than pander to popular taste. We've seen in Inception , and the Batman pictures that he knows how to tell a grand story using logic and good screen writing. He has a grand vision for what he wants to put on screen, but in Intersteller he goes over the edge. His overbearing emotional output becomes too much for the audience to carry."
" Meh
",Wistfull,28 March 2022,"Quite boring. The character's weren't believable.The plot had some thrilling bits, and the cinematography was nice.At one point, for a brief moment, they imply that if humans got the opportunity to build a perfect world exactly to their liking, it would look like a 1970s American suburb. That's the level of insight this film is working with."

" Every hour of that movie feels like seven years on earth
",cineastFGD,27 August 2015,"OK, as a start I'm not a scientist, I don't know much about astrophysics or physics in general, so you can imagine if someone like me is disturbed by the scientific level of this movie, it might mean something. I don't know whether the farmers' association of Iowa sponsored the movie, but the starting point is that due to some mysterious circumstances, sand storms and droughts plague humanity. And of all possible crops, corn, one of the least drought resistant crops, is the one to survive? This is laughable. Also, the nitrogen level in the air increases mysteriously, although we never learn why and what might cause it. The only hint we get is that our appetite for electronic gadgets might have caused this situation. OK, right! Strange enough there is nothing scientists can do about it, or they all have given up hope and now believe in Ronald Reagan playing Neil Armstrong in 'Moonlanding II'. Except for a top-secret NASA project that seeks to find a new world humanity can destroy, and that can make space rockets start unnoticed by anybody in the middle of the US. This group is apparently so short on personnel that they immediately recruit a guy, who just accidentally stumbles into their headquarter, as an astronaut. The mere fact that he once used to be a pilot out matters all missing training that astronauts usually go through before going into space. Although the crew starts out on a pretty standard 20th century space rocket, they magically transfer into a hyper-modern long distance space ship, that somehow hangs around unmanned in earth's orbit. The newly recruited pilot - having worked as a farmer for years - neatly fits into the hyper-modern apparatus without the need of any training or upgrading - some people are just gifted and act on pure instinct. We are then explained the concept of a wormhole with a piece of paper, before we, after some turmoil - caused by primitive human sentiments, such as love and aggression -, somehow end up in a black hole. At this point, my patience was drawing thin and I only occasionally took a glimpse at the film. The hero-pilot/instinct-astronaut can enter the black hole unprotected and even get out of it unharmed. Inside the black hole - which strangely enough is not black at all, but resembles a kaleidoscope on LSD - he quickly solves the formula for gravity with the help of a fellow astronaut- who happened to be dead, before he reemerges as a friend of some mysterious 5-dimensional creatures (who, by the way, remain completely mysterious all over the film). The hero- pilot/instinct-astronaut then transmits the gravity formula to his daughter on earth via Morse code (heaven forbid, if you think how long it takes just to Morse S O S, then imagine to Morse the expression ""Double integral from minus infinity to one hundred""). The genius daughter of the hero-astronaut immediately decodes the information by throwing paper sheets around and saves humanity by creating a 5 dimensional room in space (that looks pretty three dimensional) as a copy of the earth, except that there is grass on the sky (to give us an idea of the 5th dimension) ... well, if you have lost track by now don't worry, watching the movie will leave you equally puzzled. By NOT watching it, you'll save yourself the extended boring scenes of rocket wings that inflate this unedited masterpiece to nearly 3! hours, the emotional drama, and Anne Hathaway's monologue about Love, the misunderstood force that breaks all boundaries and overcomes all spaces, cringe worthy. All in all, most probably the worst sci-fi movie I've ever watched. Compared to the pseudo-science and illogic of this movie, the guys from Star Trek really appear quite believable."

",sydmwswy,7 January 2023,"The story of the film is very touching. If we remove the music from the movie, it will still be a good movie, even a better movie, maybe even a weak point. Well now if we remove the music we see that it is longer. And maybe it will be boring for the audience who likes this big movie several times. The final sequence of the film turns into a package full of long shots. Such a show is repeated in different parts of the film. Even in the views we have from space.Nolan sprinkles a silver and gold color on these shots. Men in spacesuits look much bigger than normal. Matt Damon is not believable enough. But it is good. The sequences size are too long. Nolan tries to make it bearable with music, but he doesn't succeed. I am not against this. But this work also requires a slower rhythm. The pictures are very beautiful. And they often don't look like promotional teasers..."

",blufrog49,7 November 2014,"First, I did NOT see this in IMAX.If the director's goal was to make us (me, at least) feel ignorant because all the mumbo-jumbo is over our heads, he succeeded. Visually, it's pretty good, but not nearly as good as last year's ""Gravity"" and tries to duplicate the emotions of that movie, unsuccessfully.The movie is way too long and overwrought. The acting is good, but the storyline is so convoluted that you don't really care about most of the characters.And of course (SPOILER!), the Black guy has to die.This might be worth seeing in an IMAX theater, if your ticket is discounted--otherwise wait for Netflix."

" Incredible!!!
",judemcrobbie,5 February 2021,"I hesitate to put a movie here, but this really is up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey or the first two Star wars for space movies.This contains Spoilers so please don't read this if you haven't watched it already you are only depriving yourself. Also minor spoilers for The Dark Knight (2008).The score is chilling. Hans Zimmer creates the environment perfectly and resonates each scene so well.
The movie is genuinely gorgeous. The best looking movie I think I've ever seen (either this or blade runner 2049). All the CGI fits in seamlessly and what isn't CGI is so beautifully shot, creating the beauty of our insignificance. The lighting makes the movie stand out from any other good looking movie, aesthetically. And the creativity of those camera angles are amazing. The static IMAX shot from the corner of a ship or on the shoulder of a person shot is one of the most creative ever. It presents the ideal of the world moving around the protagonists and how their mission is vital so they must not take in the environment and be single minded etc.
Matthew McConaughey's acting is special. He creates the character and THAT scene gets me every time. He delivers the caring father mentality so well that when he has to leave them, it feels like you're leaving your own children.
It is an impossibly hard concept to grasp, obviously meaning-especially considering its Nolan-that there's going to be a ton of exposition. I do not mind exposition, but for someone who gets bored easily this could be a problem. It is necessary as the concept is a tough one, however it is not done particularly well. It is quite annoying though as it makes Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) seem dumber as he has to ask questions in space, where he definitely would have been briefed on earth, just so the viewer gets to know.
The theme of love transcending space and time, albeit cheesy, is presented beautifully, especially from the performances of Matthew McConaughey (Cooper), Anne Hathaway (Brand) and Jessica Chastain (Murph).
Another Problem with Christopher Nolan, for me at least, is his choice of sound mixing. I really enjoy some of it, especially the one about how there's no sound in space which is reflected through the music. however crucial bits of dialogue are sometimes mixed so terribly that the lines are completely unintelligible. Again this is sometimes good, as it helps understand the magnitude of the sound and situation they're surrounded in but at other times it is very annoying.
Dr Mann's (Matt Damon) character is one of the most interesting, probably the most interesting in the movie. Nolan definitely had The Dark Knight (2008) in mind when writing for this character. In essence, Dr Mann embodies the idea of absurdism, or the concept of what happens to someone when confronted by the absurd. This is the idea that anyone, no matter how good they are at heart, can have one bad day and become truly evil. As alluded to, this is shown in The Dark Knight. The Joker forces the people of Gotham to face the absurd through his actions in the final act and the Coleman Rhys scene: The people in each boat facing the absurd in the chance to blow themselves, or the other boat up. And choosing to kill Coleman Rhys or let the Joker blow up a hospital. These are examples of confronting the absurd as its the choice between two losing situations, the one bad day. This is doubly so as we see Harvey Dent, 'The White Knight' the best of us too. And the Joker subjects him to his one bad day and despite being this incorruptible figure, a force for good, the joker shows anyone can fall even Harvey Dent. In The Dark Knight this idea is to show chaos in The Dark Knight, here its trying to show the themes of Nature vs Nurture and how without love a man can turn to the worst version of himself.
(The Dark Knight talk over)
The final act of the movie is one of my favourites. the deliberate ambiguity really sticks in your mind for days. It also wraps up the movie perfectly and its really got that 'Ahhh' factor that few movies manage to do. This is through everyone's arc wrapping up perfectly:
Cooper-Who was struggling to reconcile with the idea of never seeing his kids again the whole way through the movie (It being his main driving force), realises he must give up his life and ambition in the aid of humanity.
Brand-Whose love with Edmunds is her driving force. This is to get back to him (There's that transcendent nature of love again) however she loses another love, not romantically but a Philia love (Friendship love), in cooper sacrificing himself for her.
Murph-One of the main reasons for her development is due to the resentment from her dad. The final act wraps it up for her as not only does she solve an equation that has already been through one person, but also the majority of her life, she also learns to love her dad again despite him being millions of light years away (There it is again).This movie works so well as the theme, plot and characters have complete unity and harmony with each other."
" Keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better, and BETTER!
",frezeframe,7 November 2014,"""Insomnia"" is one of the top 200 films ever made. ""Inception"" is one of the top 100 films ever made.""Interstellar"" is one of the top 25 films ever made. All of Nolan's films are great. But this is better. This is something else. Granted, Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the top 10 comic book films ever made, but Interstellar takes Nolan's career to a level few have achieved. This film forever cements Christopher Nolan's place in cinema history as it will no doubt be one of the highest Academy Award nominated films in history (we shall see this upcoming March). I feel sorry for the film ""Gravity."" That film was so ground breaking in the Sci Fi/Space genre... but it only held the torch for less than a year. Interstellar blows Gravity away, like the '91 Bulls would have overpowered and embarrassed any class B college basketball team. Gravity is amateur hour compared to Interstellar- it's not even the same sport. Bold statements, I know but anyone reading this will eventually see the film, and you'll understand what I mean. Interstellar is truly a masterpiece for any generation and will be considered a pillar of achievement a century from now, much like Star Wars, Jaws, 2001 and Lord of the Rings are permanent pillars of cinema achievement. This is one of those films that changes the conversation. There has never been any movie like it, and there will never be another one like it- only imitators. Having said all that, do I really feel like Interstellar is a 10 out of 10? No, of course not. I'd say it's a 9.5. So for IMDb, that means 10. It's not the best film ever made, but it's in the same conversation as The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, E.T., T2, Avatar, 2001, etc. From this point forward, you can't have a conversation about ground breaking visual effects films, or ground breaking space dramas without mentioning Interstellar. It's that innovative. It's so innovative, in fact, that the slow start, cliché elements and improbable story set up have absolutely no effect on the film once it's over. That is rare my friends. That is a film worth seeing! Interstellar starts out slow and is overly sentimental as you'll read in a lot of reviews. You'll read that because it's true. Some of the dialog is off and the initial premise is not believable. Matthew McConaughey is one of our finest actors, but it's just not probable that an old NASA test pilot turned farmer would be seeked out by the now ""secret"" NASA who was looking for him but didn't know where to find him, and once he happens upon them by a supernatural premonition, they put him on a rocket ship a few days later with no exercise, conditioning, or up to date training. Oh and he only lives an hour drive away from NASA's secret facility. Usually a film with those kind of strikes in the first 20 minutes... you're heading for trouble. But Interstellar starts slow and keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better... until the entire audience's jaw is on the floor (To see what I mean, give a glance at the audience during the act 3 climax and you'll see something you don't see very often. Total immersion. And if you don't watch this in front of an audience on IMAX, you've missed the point.) By the time Act 2 begins, it's so powerful that none of Act 1 matters. Again, that is so rare. Only a master filmmaker can design a film in such a way. Act 3 is where cinema history is made. It wouldn't be proper to give any spoilers here, as this is a must see film. I will only say that Act 1 is good, but partially flawed... and Act 3 is so strong that it makes the plot holes of Act 1 totally irrelevant. That never happens. Don't miss Interstellar if you have a chance to see it on IMAX! But regardless of how you see it, or when; it's worth your time and money and you'll be hard pressed to find a better new movie, over the next few years- especially with the all time low quality of Hollywood blockbusters and special effects showcases. Few directors have a command of the craft of filmmaking like Christoper Nolan does. In fact, I don't think you could say there is anyone better than Christopher Nolan working right now. He may not have the body of work Spielberg, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Fincher or Soderberg have... but in the sci fi genre, Nolan is currently the best filmmaker in the world. Or you could say he's second to only James Cameron. Interstellar is a gift to us all on the same level as Avatar. Enjoy!"
" Pretty sights and a booming soundtrack can't make up for dull pacing, flat characters, a predictable plot and contrived cheese.
",briancham1994,25 May 2020,"MY BACKGROUND:
Considering all the intense feelings around Christopher Nolan that often rear their enraged heads through online amateur reviews, I must profess where I stand from the outset. I am neither a ""fanboy"" nor a ""hater"" of the Nolan brand. I prefer his work up to and including The Prestige, but not much of his work afterwards, so any overall attachment balances out. I don't feel as if I have something to prove when watching or discussing his films.That said, I am a science fiction fan (""fan"" with a lowercase ""f"" if you know what I mean; don't expect me at the next Comic-Con) so I thought this might make for interesting viewing. Lately I did some layman reading on cosmology for an unrelated project, so either I knew enough to grasp the scientific concepts in the film or I was delusional enough to believe so.THOUGHTS:
Not impressed.We start off with a dry, dusty, dismal, dying future where the protagonist (played by a perpetually bored Matthew McConaughey) struggles to keep up harvests on his family farm. We are shown (i.e. beaten on the head by) suggestions that a ""ghost"" is pushing books off his daughter's bookshelf. At that point I hoped that the climax would not involve the typical sci-fi transcendence of space and time, with the protagonist becoming this ""ghost"" and using his new-found cosmic powers to push some books around. But more on this later.From that point the film reveals two of its biggest flaws - bad pacing and bad characters. The family spends a long time going through exposition, bonding, baseball, education issues and hacking an Indian drone but never build much of a substantial relationship in the viewer's mind. It just serves to repeatedly hammer in the superficial point that the protagonist is an all-American family man who loves his daughter, but not much else.After a very long time we finally get to something related to space and the premise when the protagonist stumbles upon a top secret NASA base. The scientists all unquestioningly conclude that his finding of the base must constitute advice from magical gravity beings (what a scientific deduction) and hire him as a space pilot for a world-saving mission almost on-the-spot. Yet even after launch, the film still drags on to a degree I haven't seen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. What follows is more plodding filler scenes in orbit, near Saturn, in a lab and so on. Due to the effects of relativity, each hour passing on a watery planet they encounter is the same as seven years passing on Earth; due to the effects of slow pacing, each hour watching this movie certainly felt like seven years too. And this is coming from someone who could tolerate the pacing of Solaris!At some point on the water planet a crew member dies, but I don't remember his name, appearance or role since they were all interchangeable humans. At no point did I care about these bland, personality-deprived non-characters. This extended to the maudlin moments where the protagonist would mope over his daughter or vice versa, which just felt like shoehorned emotion without any real heart or connection. Instead of experiencing the stakes of aging, absence or the fate of the human species, I just wished for the plot to get somewhere.The gravity of the mission never really weighs in on the audience (excuse the puns) as the characters always find ways to subsume it with their personal concerns. The protagonist never shuts up about his family and never fails to base his mission decisions on their fate only. Okay, we get it, you care about your family. Can we move on now? The primary plan of Anne Hathaway's character turns out to be chasing THE POWER OF LOVE™. A stranded scientist played by Matt Damon jeopardises the mission and attempts to murder the protagonist to find a way off the planet. This may be intentional but it's hard to hold any hope for humanity when these expeditions seem to be staffed by the least professional personnel available.Near the end, the protagonist decides that he must hurl himself and a robot into the nearest black hole and send the recorded data back to Earth. He is convinced that this will work even though they establish that nothing can escape a black hole and their craft has had no success in communicating back. If the plan succeeds, the protagonist's daughter can save humanity by using the data to reconcile General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Apparently Loop Quantum Gravity doesn't already do that (did the science advisor believe LQG to be less plausible than five-dimensional bulk gravity ghosts?). Besides, if one end of a wormhole is a black hole, shouldn't they have this data already?So he executes this plan and we get the non-twist that he becomes the ""ghost"" from the beginning of the film, which should surprise nobody. Well, who else would it be? The daughter herself? (which was my backup prediction). Using THE POWER OF LOVE™ which transcends space and time (groan), he sends the data back to his daughter and she saves humanity. There's an epilogue with a cheap reunion but it just fills up time.Lest anyone think that I hate this film through and through, it does have its good moments. Even if the opening scenes dragged on for too long, they worked well to establish a dreary world where human civilisation is stagnating painfully rather than the usual sci-fi apocalypse which happens in an instant. The CGI sequences of the wormhole travel and tesseract were gorgeous and unique with interesting visual concepts like light distortion and higher dimensions. Unlike many others I found the soundtrack to be rousing and powerful rather than needlessly bombastic. It's a shame that none of it accompanied scenes with emotion of equal intensity.WHAT WOULD I DO?
Hypothetically, if I could change anything about Interstellar, what would it be?As I'm sure anyone can infer by now, my biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. There is not enough content to last for 169 minutes; cutting down to a typical runtime of 90-120 minutes would suffice. The beginning spent too long lingering on Earth introducing the setting and characters without setting up the premise. I would have majorly restructured the film so it immediately starts out in space (like Sunshine) and builds up the characters and backstory through regular, well-timed flashbacks (like Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours or LOST). These would cover all of the crew members, not just the protagonist, who would have their own distinct personalities, motivations, roles and backgrounds (more than just ""I miss my father"" and ""I am a family man""). This would give context to their behaviour and interactions in the ""present"". We should care more about these characters, who they are and whether they succeed.At the start of the third act, the cutaways would stop going to the past and start showing the time period when the children have grown up. Until this point the messages from Earth don't get through, so we don't get pointless teary moments until the relationships have been properly built up for the audience.The missions should be more coherent and less improvised. There is a proper briefing. Nobody is hired on-the-spot. The previous exploration through the wormhole used orbital and aerial robots like in Alien Planet. Who is trying to find what, where, and report it back to whom, before what deadline? Stick to one thing. Cut out the time-wasting scenario with Matt Damon's scientist.The general concept behind the tesseract climax is fine, though it is executed as a predictable deus ex machina. Don't bring in ghosts, gravity messages and trans-dimensional wormhole benefactors at the beginning. That sort of mystery is on-the-nose and the audience expects it to be explained eventually, negating any potential surprise. A good plot twist should be completely unexpected. I would make any climactic time travel explain events that the audience never realised needed an explanation, but make sense in hindsight.The time travelling actions should be more interesting than pushing books and sending data. Maybe the protagonist interacts directly with the future, or interacts with the past of a hitherto unrelated character, or something of the sort. Maybe the actions of the protagonist directly lead to human civilisation transcending space-time, so the tesseract construction concept doesn't just come out of nowhere. It also needs to feel justified thematically. The rest of the film had a strong emphasis on physics concepts and mentioned relativity a lot, which jars with the sudden revelation of infinite cosmic bookshelves inside a survivable black hole. Starting with the same fantasy tone would make the film consistent and make the climax more palatable.The epilogue is unnecessary. The protagonist already reunited with his daughter through all the time travel ghost stuff, which was cathartic enough. His actions have more meaning if they culminate in an ultimate sacrifice, so he should die in the black hole's singularity.Some other minor changes I would have made:Show alien landscapes that actually look alien, not just the ocean and Iceland.Cut out the Disney-esque, New Age, hippie nonsense about THE POWER OF LOVE™.Stop repeating that poem so many damn times.Make the robot less annoying.FINAL VERDICT:
Pretty sights and a booming soundtrack can't make up for dull pacing, flat characters, a predictable plot and contrived cheese.4.5/10"
" Still mindblown
",superbluefishycannon,4 July 2022,I have a weird routine of watching this movie every year and I am still nuts about this movie. The concept of time travel and gravity have always boggled us. What if all of it is real? What if part of the movie is non-fiction?

" Do not go gentle into that good night
",petra_ste,5 June 2015,"When it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling, you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction.The first is soothing, consolatory: characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. The second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution; by the time the story is over, events have taken a major toll on those involved - maybe they have lost what they wanted, or their achievement is implied to be short-lived. Maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all.The first kind of fiction is Spielberg, the other Kubrick; the first is Nolan of Memento, the other Nolan of Interstellar.Now, both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare; in fact, most of the time I'd rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars than a fine but bleak film like, say, The Deer Hunter. The trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds: the result will have major tonal problems.See Interstellar: in a story about entropy and loss, the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. It's fluffy and tone-deaf.Pity, because I was enjoying the movie. Acting is effective, with a solid McConaughey and an unusual supporting role for Damon; special mention to young Mackenzie Foy, who is fine as the protagonist's daughter.At its best, Interstellar provides moment of awe (the oceanic planet), compelling dilemmas, tension and pathos (the scene with Cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving); exposition is clunky-but-interesting in an Inception kind of way. But the movie lost me with its last act.When Hathaway's character (an astronaut) states, unironically, that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well, I'm both religious and a big softie so I should be on board with that... it is, however, both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin Nolan provided in The Dark Knight Rises, only it's even more inappropriate here.6,5/10"

",twominds79,12 March 2019,"I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost.
Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember.
Through the nearly 3 hours I was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. It's hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers.

" Ho Hum
",doom-ca,9 November 2014,"This movie is everything I expected it not to be. It was dramatic, but not in a good way. Over dramatic. Far, far too predictable, too Hollywood and anything, and I mean anything but scientific. I'm just going to ask this once - Chris,have you ever actually read any Stephen Hawking? Because then maybe the story line could have taken a turn toward science instead of fairy tale, Hollywood pump up the revenue box office production. Maybe someone on your crew could have consulted with Hawking and came up with an alternate ending. One where people who enter black holes get broken up into their atomic parts such as happens to even light. Instead of some fantasy land Disney ride. Wow what garbage.The trailer in this movie made it look like an amazing adventure in deep space. And yes, don't get me wrong there is space, and a few time deadlines to add in some much needed suspense after one too many porch scenes with Grandpa drinking beer while tending the corn fields. However, what this movie lacked was a sense of logic. I mean really. Flat out.The blight that is taking down the humans seems to be completely overlooked in the movie. There really is no information on it except, our atmosphere has a lot of nitrogen in it which is feeding the blight. ""huh?"" The earth is written off in this movie because of blight? This earth has survived, earthquakes, giant meteorites, plagues, famines, flooding and we are done in by a blight?Fine, we can't feed people so we are headed for the stars, all covertly of course. And our hero just happens to stumble upon NASA. Which wants him to be the pilot, even though he's a reluctant farmer, who was a pilot - because as a pilot he's the best of the best with honors. The script felt like something I would read in an old spaghetti western Clint Eastwood movie. I feel like I threw money away on a cheap plot based on oversimplification of scientific notions and box office greed. And the end: omg it's ""time,"" no, no it's ""gravity,"" no it's time. Just stop. And our protagonist surviving a black hole. What? Because it's not a black hole? Human's built it? Future humans. Probably the one's from Futurama. OK I've seen enough roll credits. However, that said, if you want some good sound, yes the sound was good. Good visuals, nothing gravity didn't do better, and descent acting, almost like Armageddon, yah know, the Bruce Willis stuff. Then indeed this is your movie. Trust me, this is no Inception. If you go, enjoy, just don't go in with high expectations (9.1 on IMDb? really?)or you'll be let down.Oh and the 2001 monolith robots were the highlight of the movie for me. They were good for a couple of laughs. Have a good one."

Love for fame, for science, for your fellow humans, for mother, father and children, for your dead ones, for the unborned ones. You name it.This move reconciles the working class with the intelectual/elite class and puts them in the same level of importance. I have never seen a portrayal of this so balanced.It's the first exploration of the universe as a physical ""need"" and not as a ""curiosity"".This movie has so many nuances and perspectives that a narrow mind like mine cannot explain them accurately.

Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there.I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final ""explanation"" of the film's phenomena has a ""Sixth Sense"" feeling to it.

",pontificator,11 November 2014,"reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that I watched the same movie everyone is gushing about. the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome i.e. after trashing this planet lets go trash some others. the black hole visualizations were quite lame. this is not a great sci-fi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking non-sci-fi buff. a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story. these are yet to be made such as ringworld, dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts. to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange, although it is somewhat understandable as the afore-mentioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piece."

" Nolan is intelligent and will recover but might benefit from making smaller films which can still support some of his bigger ideas.
",Likes_Ninjas90,4 November 2014,"Amidst the stars in the galaxy known as Hollywood a deep mystery remains: who is Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker? After seeing Interstellar in IMAX, his ninth and least satisfying film, the question perpetuates. Nolan is one of the most powerful and bankable directors in the world. Together, his last four films earned nearly four billion dollars. Money builds opportunities and egos in Hollywood and consequently each entry in Nolan's filmography has grown in size and scope. Yet outside of his admiration for 35 mm film and practical effects, grasping Nolan's auteurist imprint is difficult. He says he wants to make the biggest film possible but so does Michael Bay. Nolan's films walk a difficult line, balancing large ideas and explosions, proving blockbusters don't have to be mindless. But these are studio films, without insight into the filmmaker himself like transparent ideological goals. In interviews, Nolan mirrors this impersonal nature. He is softly spoken, measured and serious, concurrent with the thematic goals of his films like the hidden identities of men. In 2010 The Guardian asked if Nolan is the new Stanley Kubrick, a misguided comparison with superficial parallels. Kubrick distanced himself from Hollywood by owning his own cameras and editing equipment. He also relied on the specificity of images to create meaning rather than dialogue, making his films cinematic in form, not merely scope. Stylistically Terrence Malick (The Tree of Life) is a more appropriate companion to Kubrick. Artistically, Nolan shares more in common with Steven Spielberg as both directors inject ideas into the existing framework of sizable studio films. Spielberg was originally hired to direct Interstellar with Nolan's brother Jonathan writing the script from an idea by physicist Kip Thorne. Christopher Nolan replaced Spielberg and helped rewrite his brother's script. The first hour of Jonathan's original script was set on Earth and retained but his brother's decision to refine the space elements has drawn comparisons to Kubrick's flawed masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey and Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.To this point, I have enjoyed many of Nolan's films but Interstellar's script is terribly inconsistent. Using a mostly narrow, linear structure, the narrative hurls ideas at us about climate change, parenting, space exploration, time travel and alternate dimensions, but the script lacks refinement. The Nolans talk over us, not to us. In a self-conscious move to intellectualise a ""save the world"" story, they substitute detailed characterisation and backstory in favour of impenetrable scientific discussions about relativity and gravity. An embarrassingly rich cast is left to substantiate these thinly realised characters. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is a former pilot who is now a widowed farmer with two young children, including a girl named Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and an ageing father-in-law (John Lithgow). Cooper, not dissimilar to Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, is an archetype of the reckless parent who is sentimentally motivated by his children and largely only interesting because of McConaughey's predictable charisma. Earth is doomed because of dust storm and droughts, a nod to The Grapes of Wrath, leading Cooper to be tasked by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) with travelling into space and investigating three potentially inhabitable planets. Another major character is Brand's astronaut daughter Amelia (surely named after Amelia Earhart), played by Anne Hathaway. Her reliable expressiveness instills some surface emotions to an otherwise stony character, with no backstory or arc. Other actors are either underused or have distracting cameos. An actress the quality of Jessica Chastain deserved a bigger part but only features deep into the story in a forgettable role as the adult Murph.This time the self-seriousness which gave the Batman films a unique stylistic tone is Nolan's Achilles' heel. While desperate for the story to emotionally resonate, resorting to extended close-ups of Cooper crying for leaving his children behind, he remains unaware of the story's absurdity. It is an insurmountable task when the dialogue is dry, textbook theory and the plotting becomes increasingly ridiculous, attempting to marry between the spaces of a bookcase shelf the pretensions of alternate dimensions with a family melodrama. There are also episodes where the stock characters fail to move us. During the exploration of the first planet a side character is killed, which expectedly strikes a chord with Cooper and Amelia, but matters little to us when we've barely come to know the character's name. Other singular moments remind us of how skillful Nolan is with set pieces. The first entry into outer space is intensely realised, with the galaxy being simultaneously beautiful and dangerous. The infrequency of these emotions stresses how undisciplined the narrative is, particularly in an incoherent, final hour, which doesn't utilise the multilayered structure of The Dark Knight Rises or strike Inception's emotional high notes.Watching the film in the IMAX format is as inconsistent as the narrative. Hoyte van Hoytema, the usually reliable Dutch-Swedish photographer who shot Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Her and Let the Right One In with great symmetry, has replaced Nolan's regular photographer Wally Pfister. Surprisingly, the early scenes on Cooper's farmhouse are poorly lit and the images are muddy and graining, a deliberate imitation of the sandstorms, but an ugly choice all the same. Other shots use the full volume of the IMAX screen and the scale is impressive. Some of the galactic images are awe-inspiring and vivid but their scarcity coupled with the tight, obstructed camera-work inside the spacecraft, is disappointing. Uncharacteristically, Nolan's pacing is also laborious, dragging the film to his longest running time of nearly three hours. The film isn't as calculated as 2001, a difficult feat for any director, but pales substantially to last year's terrific Alfonso Cuaron film Gravity, which eclipses Interstellar for precision. It was made for sixty-five million dollars less. It is half the length and aside from being a technically superior film, it understands the futility of a large canvas unless our emotional investment is supported by strong characters."
" Epic in every way!
",sanjay219,4 November 2014,"Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!"

This robot never does anything much,except wiggle its segments and occasionally respond to voice...Then the trip into space, on a Saturn 5 rebuild, that links up to a spacecraft fixture in space, which promptly begins revolving to produce pseudo-gravity...A boring flight out to Saturn, through the wormy hole, and we arrive at somewhere else, supposedly a planet...land ""in"" the water, get thrashed by a tsunami, and here we are...still no solid plot at all...I remember watching the movie Contact, which was boring in it's own way, but this one is ten times worse...only one step above awful..."

" MicroReels Film Review - Interstellar
",krahl-81949,25 November 2015,"I'm a big fan of anything Sci-Fi and I've always been interested in the boundaries that directors push when it comes to imagining the impossible and predicting or presenting the future on screen. While most science fiction films step over into the fantastical and often prioritize the ""Fi"" over the ""Sci"", Interstellar is one of those rare gems that balances the two elements and also delivers a spectacularly entertaining movie.Any doubts I had going into the film about a dramatic SciFi being directed by Christopher Nolan were instantly muted as soon as the movie and its tremendous score began. While Nolan excelled with The Prestige and Inception, they did leave something to be desired and I was fresh off the Batman trilogy bandwagon. But Nolan excels yet again, directing the film with such confidence and control that it's almost impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Each and every aspect of his signature style is also prominently visible through the film.Continue reading the review at my blog below:https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/11/25/interstellar-film- review/"

" Astonishing sci-fi
",masonsaul,24 August 2020,"Interstellar is an astonishing sci-fi film that's thought provoking, emotional, breathtaking and complex. Matthew McConaughey gives an incredible lead performance and Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Mackenzie Foy and David Gyasi all give great supporting performances. Christopher Nolan's direction is phenomenal and with Hoyte Van Hoytema as director of photography, consistently visually stunning. The visual effects are flawless. It's extremely well paced and the music by Hans Zimmer is beautiful."
" Depressing but Visually Stunning.
",anaconda-40658,25 December 2015,"Interstellar (2014): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Michael Caine: The future looks grim with sand storms destroying everything and corn pretty much the only thing growing. As with Inception, Christopher Nolan toys with the theme of time. This time a farmer and pilot, played by Matthew McConaughey leaves his young son and daughter with their grandfather and then leads an expedition to space through a worm hole. This is in hopes of finding planets to colonize on. Unfortunately complication arise when McConaughey discovers that his son and daughter are now grown adults in the span of a few hours that he was on the first planet, surfaced mainly of water. Watching someone be subdued with grieving regret while his children rapidly grow old is very depressing. It lends the idea of valuing time spent with loved ones. McConaughey is caught in such a dilemma and hopes that his daughter is bright enough to figure it all out. Anne Hathaway plays the daughter of the scientist heading the research, and who joins McConaughey on the mission. Jessica Chastain plays the now grown daughter, stubborn, determined, and clever to boot. Matt Damon plays an astronaut revived from hyper sleep on an ice planet with a secret mission of his own. Michael Caine plays the scientist heading the research that might outlive him. This is hardly an uplifting experience but it contains Nolan's signature curiosity of time. Glorious special effects are out of this world creating what science only dreams of. Score: 8 / 10"
" One of the best films I have ever seen
",bb52366,12 July 2022,"First time I saw it was back in 2014 in Imax and it was hands down the best film I have ever seen in theaters.

I would highly recommend giving this film a watch if you haven't already."
" They forgot to take the robot out of the box
",doughelo,17 November 2014,"Somewhere in Interstellar is a decent 90 minute movie padded to 3 hours. I thought it might feel long; what I didn't expect was the cheap, weepy emoting and Hallmark philosophizing.As for the padding, at least 40 minutes goes by before anyone mentions space, yet nothing of the ecological disaster is explained in any depth. No point is so trivial it can't be made ten times, no scene so long it can't be stretched beyond the breaking point. And oh, the sap – love is described as a kind of quantum effect that transcends time and space (as long as it's between parent and child).The supposed scientific accuracy was limited largely to the depiction of stellar lensing around the black hole and the silence of space. Howevvver Why do pickup trucks look exactly the same in the future? Why is the dust all over the trucks and house but not the crops? That was the most ridiculous robot I've ever seen (I love the comment that it was made of ""spinning HVAC ducts""). How does this lurching refrigerator even get itself through a hatch? Its interface is a crude text screen worthy of a PCjr, yet it has a complete human personality (so much so that I had a hard time distinguishing its voice from the crew).Do you always launch your rockets from the middle of your office buildings? Remarkable how those glass partitions in view stood up to the blast.Apparently having no idea of what a wormhole is BEFORE being sent through one, Matthew is shown the rudimentary folded paper analogy. Wouldn't that have come up on the first day of class? How does a mile-high wave form out of foot-deep water? The planet orbits a black hole? Where's your light and heat coming from? Any problem with the intense X-rays usually found around these things? Guess not.On Matt Damon's planet, exactly why aren't the ""frozen clouds"" falling? At least Avatar posited superconducting rocks and intense magnetic fields to explain their floating mountains.When Matt takes Matthew out to show him the ""surface"", just how far do they walk? The rescue pilot flies at hundreds of miles an hour for at least a few minutes.When Cooper returns to our solar system, at least 60 years has elapsed since he received his daughter's video messages (since she is now in her 90s or more), so has Anne Hathaway been alone all that time on her planet? I don't recall any mention that she was going to be in a slow time region. By the way, time only slows down significantly in a very high gravitational field, which they showed no signs of being in.Besides all that and much more, the plot was disjointed, with inarticulate dialog and confusing placement of people. For example, during the entire scene of the boosted entry towards the black hole, I didn't know Cooper was in the shuttle, separated from Anne Hathaway in the station, until he looked across at her.It's not a completely terrible movie, there are some great visuals that are impressive in IMAX. But they're dragged down with the padding and cheap sentiment."
" Inter-not quite-stellar
",Fluke_Skywalker,2 April 2015,"Unlike, say, Michael Bay, Christopher Nolan always reaches for the highest rung on the ladder. It's an admirable trait, and the results certainly speak for themselves. Unfortunately with 'Interstellar' his grasp on that rung is often tenuous, and the result is a film where awesome and awful play tug of war.Technically the film is brilliant. The F/X and the cinematography are absolutely first-rate. It's too bad they're in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story. The cast do what they can, but there's just nothing here for them to gain purchase, and as a result I experienced a total emotional detachment throughout."

One that is placed aaaaalllllll the way out near Saturn by someone we don't know (but lead to believe its evolved humans). I say, why not have the wormhole next to Earth? who knows. Did evolved humans make the wormhole? if so, how did they get off Earth to evolve and put it there?To watch the film is nice, the space scenes are stunning and film stock nice.

They were all very spectacularly made. It was just a movie that I could just sit back relax and watch and not search for every incorrect miniscule detail. Now it probably isn't the most interesting thing for kids, and the ending makes a perfect storyline go a little wonky.

" By So Far, The Worst Movie In 15 Years. Period.
",denis888,21 June 2015,"This is awful. Awful in every single sense - this length of three endless hours, this snotty sentimental atmosphere, these unbearably slow and hammy dialogs. Everything is poor and mediocre in this production. The tonality is set wrong and it is false all through. Then, the cast - Matthew McConaughey is teary, lame and languid. He is the weakest chain here and his efforts to be endearing or touchy do not touch or endear. Anne Hathaway? Probably, her worst part in years. Michael Caine? John Lithgow? Nope, lame at all costs. Avoid this poorly scripted, badly shot, lousily edited slowpoke of a torture. This is just a mere waste of time, and the idea is lost in utter drabness. Let's be honest - I did not understand the idea, the moral and the message. I was totally sucked and drained. And them, this horrendous loud music that deafens the dialog and simply deafens. Why? Why was that so loud and boring? In a word, bad. Bad, bad, bad thing. The worst in years, and I mean it."
" So, They Could Communicate with the Past, and They Failed to Tell Which Planet?
",j889,2 June 2019,"I believe this movie should be rated 5-6 stars.
Cooper had the ability to communicate with the past, he just can't tell NASA or his daughter the destination???
If Cooper gave the right information, they could avoid all the death and sacrifice.Mankind from the future could control gravity, and space time, and they failed to gave solution to blight????When Cooper returned to the space station, he could share all his adventure stories, so future generations learnt his adventure, and in time, when they have the scientific ability, they could pass this information to Cooper in the first place or even people from even earlier. It's a paradox.Nolan tried to be scientifically correct. Cooper gave his daughter a mechanical Hamilton watch. I believe everyone knows how a mechanical watch, it is driven by springs and gears. A mechanical watch's movement direction won't be changed permanently by gravity. Gravity would slow down the watch, but when gravitational influence were gone, the movement should go back to normal, so there is no way, Cooper could use gravitational force to ""encode"" a message into the mechanical watch because the hand of the watch wouldn't stay ""jumpy"": moving back and foreth. He would have better luck using gravity to leave message on the floor. The whole ""watch"" narrative was a big mistake.Cooper loved his daughter, okay, but what about the other kid? He acted as if he only had one kid. That's just weird.It is a good movie, black hole, wormhole stuff are easy to understand, but when you really put your brain to it, you see plot holes. Entertaining but this movie is actually quite stupid."

" Scores on effects, fails on narrative!
",ssvikas,22 July 2015,"Christopher Nolan is known to experiment, such as the the non-linear narrative of 'Memento' and well written characters in 'The Dark Knight'. A director of his caliber also made the disappointing pseudo- intellectual 'Inception'. Sadly, 'Interstellar' too comes across as a let-down of sorts, despite interesting science.'Interstellar' has all the ingredients of a typical space sci-fi film: spacecraft, wormholes, stasis, strange planets, time travel, a black hole, robots running on artificial intelligence, father-daughter drama, etc., in the background of a dying Earth. While these concepts aren't new to Hollywood, the big budget allowed for the visual spectacle. Still, it is marred by choppy narrative, clichéd dialog and poorly developed characters that we hardly care about.Set in unspecified future, Earth's capacity to sustain life has diminished; crops are dying and there are dust storms. Agriculture takes precedence over everything. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA test pilot turned farmer. A widowed Cooper lives with his father in law and children Tom and Murph. An inquisitive young Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is obsessed with the idea of a ghost in her bedroom and is always trying to decode signs.As it turns out, the signs are coordinates to a hidden space station of NASA, headed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), in search of life sustaining planets so as to evacuate Earth. Predictably, our hero, Cooper is the only man who can pilot the mission to outer space, beyond our galaxy accessed through a wormhole. Damn, a trespasser at a hidden space station is suddenly asked to commandeer a spaceflight without any serious briefing or training!Joining Cooper on the mission are Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and two other scientists that are expendable. Their mission is finding three of the ten manned probes that went through the portal earlier and have reported seemingly positive findings. Again, don't ask why manned missions when they had advanced AI robots like TARS and CASE? That brings us to the existential question: why a manned follow-up mission, huh?The overarching premise behind the mission is that certain benevolent 'beings' have opened up a wormhole and left clues through gravity- based anomalies. The aging professor has been working on a mathematical model to evacuate Earth. The model fails since it needs data from a gravitational singularity, where space and time can be bent. If Plan- A, to evacuate fails, Plan-B to populate extraterrestrial planets with genetic samples humans.Unbeknownst to the fatality of Plan-A, the crew continues to explore planets. One Planet has time distorted to a level where an hour on it equals seven years on earth. The planet doesn't make the cut due to its shallow waters and gigantic waves. The second is an icy planet with ice-clouds (filmed in Iceland) and a crazed explorer (Matt Damon) who tries to kill Cooper so that he can execute plan B at the third planet, Miller; Result: needless drama.As with every movie involving vehicles, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, fuel shortage and damage to the craft and the need for Singularity data are key plot elements towards the climax. Apropos, they need to slingshot past the black hole to the third planet which Amelia bets on, as her loved one went there during the original Lazarus project. Oh, a movie is so incomplete without a love angle! Glad there wasn't any romance between Cooper and Ameila.And then, our hero, Cooper dives into the event horizon of the beautifully depicted super-massive black hole and reaches singularity. But what is this singularity? Just like the limbo being linked to Cobb's dreams in 'Inception', the singularity in 'Interstellar' is actually a four dimensional tesseract presenting a single location to Cooper at various points in time. And the location? You guessed it: Murph's bedroom. How convenient!So, who's the ghost in Murph's life? Cooper! And the 'beings'? Cooper again! He opened up the wormhole near Saturn that took him through the same spot half a century later. Doesn't this create an inconsistent causal loop just like 'Grandfather Paradox' or a chicken going back in time and laying an egg that it is born out of? But then, an average moviegoer doesn't care as long as there are spectacular sights and happy endings!'Interstellar' is lengthy and tiresome, narrative is patchy and has excessive inter-cuts during crucial scenes. Spoiling experience further is the jarring and ominously heavy background score by Hans Zimmer that muffles out dialog. Acting is just passable: McConaughey is hardly a fit, Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph is decent as the scientist and Michel Caine seems to be having his fourth outing with the director.Nolan's fiction works for audiences who believe they enjoy intelligent films, but actually watch them without thought or logic. As contradictory as it sounds, truth is stranger than fiction. Nolan's 'Inception' was full of plot holes, irrespective of whether it was deliberate or inept storytelling. Usually, a good narrative should have a logical end, except that it is Nolan and he likes keeping things ambiguous. I haven't come across anyone who understood 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' fully, despite claiming that they loved it.About the science in 'Interstellar', Nolan found played it safe by bringing a scientist on board, Kip Thore, as a consultant and executive producer. This would've surely had an impact on the depiction of a spinning black hole and other stuff like the four- dimensional tesseract within the event horizon, boxy but versatile AI robots, etc. Nonetheless, I'm still amazed at how an astronaut can dive into a black hole and come out totally unhurt!!If anything, Christopher Nolan must be admired for dreaming big. Sadly, this movie is a waste of a great concept turned into an average movie that sells only the basis of special effects bankrolled by a big budget. While die-hard Nolan fans would rave over this, discerning movie connoisseurs won't appreciate the poor storytelling."

" Overly Long With Little Real Purpose Or Meaning
",sddavis63,1 November 2015,"It's almost as if those who made this movie wanted to use two and a half hours of less than stellar movie making (if you'll pardon the pun) just so that the viewer could tough it out to the end and see a ridiculously sentimental ending. Really, by the time the end finally came, I found myself wondering what the point of the whole thing was. Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer in the midwest United States struggling along with his family to survive in some future world in which humanity is facing extinction. The atmosphere is changing so that there's less and less oxygen, and it's becoming harder and harder to grow crops. In this part of the world at least everyone seems to survive on a diet of corn, corn and more corn while being constantly threatened by horrible dust storms. I'm assuming this is meant to portray an environmental catastrophe. Eventually, Cooper and his daughter Murph (played as a young girl by Mackenzie Foy, who did well in the part) become aware that they're receiving some strange signal and they head out to investigate - an investigation that eventually leads to Cooper leaving Murph and the rest of his family behind to explore space in the hopes of finding a new home for humanity.I get it. I just didn't get excited by it. And I struggled from the start (well, once Cooper was picked for the mission anyway) with the question of why Cooper wasn't simply recruited for the mission from the beginning. He's clearly the best pilot around - which Professor Brand (Michael Caine) states openly - and he was immediately put in command of the mission, which made me wonder why they were just going to leave him playing farmer if he was really that good! That bugged me all the way through. But what bugged me more was that there was no consistency to this. There didn't seem to be any real direction to it; it didn't seem to be leading anywhere. I thought the storyline involving Mann (Matt Damon) was extraneous and just added time to the movie without adding much in the way of substance. There are a few places where it seemed as if the movie was trying to pay tribute in some way to ""2001"": particularly around the character of the robot TARS, and even some of the special effects/cinematography, but as I said it just didn't seem to be leading anywhere, and I wasn't entirely certain if this mission had accomplished much of anything.The entire movie seemed to be little more than a vehicle getting us to the sentimental ending. Murph had been angry that her father had left her behind, but she remembered that he promised he'd see her again, but because of differences in the way time would pass for the two of them (see: the theory of general relativity) she might be the same age as him by the time that happened. As it turned out, Murph was an old lady by the time Cooper returned to earth, and we get the sight of Cooper visiting his daughter in the hospital on her deathbed. Sentimental, yes, but I'm not sure it made the long wait to get there worthwhile. (4/10)"
" Miserable inter human nonsense
",alfa-624-376688,30 November 2014,"Interstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage (2014) as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space.It let me so down! Instead of a true vision for the future Interstellar works out an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship. Sorry Christopher Nolan but this is not what I payed for! Why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? The unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless. Austronauts don't go into space without a strict course. So not in Interstellar, in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take. This is supposed to be science? Don't make laugh!

I pretty much relied on the synopsis to understand what was going on, and if a film is that hard for me to follow, then it obviously just isn't for me. I can't fault the visuals, music or the majority of the acting - just the story, and in particular the turn it took at the end...what was that? why? there was no need! I was bored at the start. Then the film peaked my interest once they were in space and then the turn it took just made me fed up and annoyed. I don't seem to love Christopher Nolan as much as everyone else does, i enjoyed his earlier films and two of the Batman films but most of his films just end up boring me. It's disappointing because i usually always love his casting choices and i want to like his films but most of them just don't engage me. Maybe he just isn't for me. Jon enjoyed this more than me and gave it 7/10 but even he admitted that he didn't understand the majority of it and he also enlisted the help of the synopsis. I guess if you haven't watched it give it a go, you may enjoy it or like me you might wish that you'd spent the past three hours doing something else..."
" A classic? Nope, more like a Heinz 57 varieties
",paulcf-510-910462,9 November 2014,"I had high expectations for this film by Chris Nolan. ""Inception"" was ground breaking, you could definitely say it had never been 'done before' or seen that before! The pre release hype was strong for Interstellar and I really enjoy SF movies, so pass the popcorn!SPOILERS: Firstly character wise...There is zero chemistry between Cooper and Dr. Brand! Yet in the end, we're being told/shown that there is/will be? Really? Then Dr. Mann, he was asleep for years and when they wake him, they don't verify his claims? And his mental status? Why was he sent on this mission in the first place? And he easily removes the communication device from Cooper's helmet, and so on. Really cheesy and poorly written. Then he escapes in the craft to get to the Endurance, hello? No security protocols? It is so unbelievable.Time flashbacks...Cooper can revisit time, so why not pick a time he can really affect? Maybe further back and even help to prevent the natural environmental breakdowns that Earth is experiencing in this story.Robots...black monoliths...hello where have I seen that before? Is this the shape that a space exploration robot would be designed as? This was so silly I couldn't stop laughing!Fuel: They have a limited supply! OMG! Ever hear of nuclear power like in a submarine, etc? Also I would expect them to have perfected nuclear fusion or such to provide unlimited (almost) power. But no, they use chemical rockets (technology from the 1940's). This was so poorly written.Let's not forget 'Waterworld' even, when they land on the water planet. Gee, maybe a survey/probe first would be in order? And then the other planet, looked a lot like the ice world in the 'Star Trek' movie a few years ago where Jim Kirk is exiled to and meets Spock.And the most bizarre of all? He gets coordinates of a TOP SECRET base and he's just the person they want to fly the spacecraft? And no one else could find this base? Did the workers there need food from local providers? Anyways, you get my point, it is so disjointed and when you watch it, it is a melange of many previous movies, hence Heinz 57 varieties. It carries bits of '2001 A Space Odyssey' (and its sequels also) which is a natural one to look to. Then 'Contact' and many more...truly picking experiences from a bevy of SF movies and mixing them. At least they didn't have thruster sounds in space! (no sound in space, remember 'Aliens'? No one will hear you scream!) Is this the best that Chris Nolan and Hollywood can come up with? No original screenwriter/story out there? My final measurement of a film is will I buy the Blu-ray disc when it comes out? Nope, not for this extremely long and drawn out film. I might buy it in the cheapo bin for $3.99 in a few years time and watch it just for the extras/deleted scenes and then put it on the shelf to gather dust.So just like in the movie, I was hoping for a worm hole to get to the end of this long drawn out tedium...but unfortunately for me, time was actually going to be moving much longer than normal time and I've lost 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. So terribly disjointed with decent actors trying to save it.Unless you are starving for a SF movie, avoid this like a bad worm hole and keep your feet planted on terra firma. Folks, this is a really terrible movie and I would avoid it and save your money for something else."

" Boring and cliché - the nice art of Hollywood trailers
",bogdanrc,6 November 2014,"I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Big fan of Nolan's work, except Inception.The movie is a soup of physics and personalities clichés, overstretched over 3 hours of beautiful visuals braided with a childish plot and stupid characters. A similar movie which comes to mind is Prometheus.There is absolutely no connection with the people involved, and each and every one of them became unlikeable at some point in time.The attempts to define the way people behave are as childish as the plot that reverts into itself. Worse than the worst episode from the Star Trek saga.Apparently Hollywood must stick with the trailers, as they are brilliant. The movies that follow are trash.Nolan should come down from the sky ego he's in, and start making good intelligent movies again. Such a pity...IMDb of 9.3?! How many paid people are there to score 10s?!"
" The best movie ever made
",kindofperson,25 June 2021,"Sure, i love a lot of movies, from simple : 12 angry men to more complex like Inception, fantasy (Avatar) and a lot of other great movies out there.But Interstellar..the feeling you get at the end, with the perfect music and the incredible visuals really make you believe this is the best movie of all time.I don t think there is anywone who didn't watch it at this point but if..IF somehow you missed it, DROP EVERYTHING AND WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!"

" Gone To Earth
",writers_reign,8 November 2014,"I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on, right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell."

" In Space No One Can Hear You Yawn
",BRYN-26,9 November 2014,"Originality: This movie was completely original, in the exact same way that the Hunger Games was, that is, not at all. The Hunger Games is to Battle Royale as Interstellar is to 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is, a complete rip off. Many reviews are saying how original it is, I expect these people haven't seen 2001.Score: A few people have drawn parallels with Contact, saying that the movie reminds them of Contact. Perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that Interstellar ripped off?Millennium Falcon: When our heroes first take off from Earth they do so in a Saturn V type moon rocket, with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. Yet, when they later take off from the extra-solar planets, one with 130% gravity no less, they do so in the conventional Millennium Falcon kind of sci-fi way. It huts my eyes!Southern Drawl: Our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry half-awake speech, yet later seemed to recover. Perhaps that's what time-dilation does for you!The Robot: Seriously? I think it was so big and square because it contained two CRT-monitors. If you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission, then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in Interstellar. But my biggest gripe was, how did it walk? We have two legs(!), our trailing leg doesn't catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends, lifting us slightly. The robot in Interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks (but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design).Newton's 3rd Law: Stated correctly, applied incorrectly. If our heroes' spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun, then it would have been a cool quip, instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer.The Best of the Best: Why! Why is Hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? Couldn't he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? (with a genius daughter and an idiot son).Frozen Yoghurt: At one point the Millennium Falcon Space Shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt (or was it ice?), so, a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt, sounds a bit silly. Presumably, as with Arthur Dent's cup, it was held up by art?Emotional: But not a black hole. Possibly the best element of the movie. The human element, and the pain of loss and separation was, strangely, conveyed extremely well.A real Black Hole: Well, I wish I had one so I could get the 3 hours back that I lost watching this. It's not all bad, some bits are compelling, but mostly it's a boring re-skin of 2001."
" My All-Time Favourite Movie
",jmrtjtj,28 June 2022,"This movie is simply amazing. The acting, the writing, the emotion that this film holds is simply outstanding. I cry almost every time I see it. However, the greatest part of this movie is the entire storyline. It's a complex, masterful and very imaginable plot, that definitely holds your attention the whole time. Please just watch this movie, it is spectacular."
" Awful Beyond Imagining
",pwiener-592-552778,6 November 2014,"I was bored and love science fiction movies, so I saw half of ""Interstellar"" - way too much of it. Since I expected nothing, I wasn't disappointed: that's what I got. Few friends probably planned to see it, so there was no point in telling them not to. It has not a single redeeming feature, and shamelessly copies many films and TV series - 2001, not the least of them. I've seen better sci-fi on 50s or 70s television. It's 100% cliché-ridden from the git-go - the characters, the story, the actors (no acting is necessary!), the ""cinematography"" (almost non-existent) the music, the locations, the sets, even the editing. What an embarrassment, an insult. It's a film worthy of this year's midterm elections, as it cynically abandons all pretense and respect for imagination, experience, science, detail, creativity, or humor. It is written and plays to the lowest level of intelligence - the entire film does nothing but fulfill expectations set in the first few minutes. You might as well listen to the movie as a podcast. Matt McConnaughey has never been so stereotypically bad. I hope it destroys a few careers. It should."
" The Best Movie That I Have Ever Seen
",ashazjw123,8 February 2023,"This movie is the most beautiful, creative, realistic and emotional movie that I have ever seen. I genuinely believe that this movie is the most perfect movie ever. This movie has everything: love, betrayal, suspense, mystery, action, happiness and connection. This movie is just done so well. The plot is so well written. It is very hard to stop watching this movie.The casting is amazing. The acting is over the top. I am starting to think that Matthew McConaughey is one of the best actors ever. The VFX are a beauty and the characters? Don't get me started. The dialogue is written in such a mysterious but realistic way. I am in love with this movie. This is also a very long movie and I do think that it is a bit of a headache but I would be lying if I said that my mind wasn't blown because it was! I don't think I will ever see another movie. 10/10. You have to watch this movie!"
" Not what I expected......
",jamgood-842-448084,21 January 2015,"I think I watched the same film as all the others on here that disliked it. I enjoyed the cinematography and the effects but there is really nothing else about this film I can say I liked.I think Matthew McConaughey is a great character actor but in this film he just didn't fit, for me. His voice, stance, mannerisms all seem out of place. Like he just didn't care and wanted the paycheck. Not that all the blame for the bad film can be put on his shoulders. The rest of the cast, all but a small few of them, just weren't entertaining.From the maker of Inception I expected more. What I got was nearly 3 hrs of not a very good film.3/10 for the visuals. That's all I got. Disappointed."

" The Bad Christopher Nolan Movie
",johnspringer-95440,2 February 2023,"Christopher Nolan's made a lot of great movies. He's also made a couple conceptually cool movies that didn't quite work (looking at you, TENET.) And there's this misbegotten utter garbage. A film that promises to deliver a realistic cinematic examination of relativity, time dilation and intergalactic travel is actually a cloying family drama in which any semblance of scientific reality gets chucked out the space ship's power window in favor of some smarmy absolute nonsense about benevolent interdimensional aliens (see Contact, also starring Matthew McConaughey for some reason) and the power of love or something. What a waste."

" A science fiction movie that is definitely worth watching
",maryolalov,17 February 2017,"A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so (maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the third watch.Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic. But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic.Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind.Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching."

" Detached drivel, just about watchable
",Jim-Eadon,10 September 2015,"This awkward movie felt like Sci Fi produced by a technical, corporate entity. The idea was fairly cute. Much depended on the mourning by the daughter, but the actress didn't make me care about her. The protagonist didn't make me care about him either, for that matter. I thought the female astronaut was quite engaging but the movie was the most interesting, her choices, angst and suffering were the only interesting thing about the movie. The Black Hole stuff was horrible, but even the black hole in this movie is not volume enough for the plot holes and miraculous coincidences that drive the story. He was only able to communicate via a malfunctioning watch, What the...? Nothing in this movie made sense. Every major scene was blatantly impossible. Worst of all, there was no warmth, no compassion, no style, no love."
